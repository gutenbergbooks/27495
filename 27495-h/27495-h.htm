<h2>AS GOOD AS GONE.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>"You won't be any more use to us after
this," said Gertrude positively.</p>

<p>A quick flush coloured Denys's cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gertrude! why not?"</p>

<p>"Engaged girls never are the least use to
their families," reiterated Gertrude. "All they
think about is the postman and their bottom
drawer. The family goes to the wall, its
interests are no longer of interest, its sewing is
no longer necessary, its duties&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>But Denys's good-tempered laugh rippled
out and interrupted the flow of eloquence.</p>

<p>"Really, Gertrude! you are too funny!"</p>

<p>"I don't feel at all funny," grumbled Gertrude,
half laughing and half ashamed of
herself, "only I'm quite busy enough, and I
can't be piled up with any of your odds and
ends! Talking of bottom drawers," she added,
more contented now she had said her say, "if
I were you I would put away all your
ornaments and vases, or Pattie will break them
all before you are married."</p>

<p>Denys's eyes wandered round the room,
the dear old night nursery where she had slept
with one after another of the babies. The
walls were adorned with coloured prints, of
which the stories had been told and re-told to
Tony and little Jerry and baby Maude, and
the odds and ends of little ornaments and
carved brackets had each its own history of a
birthday or a holiday or a keepsake. There
was nothing of value, except in the value of
association, and Denys smiled tenderly as she
shook her head.</p>

<p>On this evening, when she was just engaged
to be married, every association in the room
was tugging at her heart, and weaving its
threads into the new fabric of joy that was
spread out before her.</p>

<p>Gertrude's glance followed hers round the
room.</p>

<p>"It isn't a half bad room," she remarked,
"only those rubbishy old pictures spoil it.
When you are gone I shall have this room and
you will see the difference I shall make. What
a joke it will be to see you come poking round
to see all our arrangements then!"</p>

<p>With a gay little laugh, she rubbed her
pretty round cheek against Denys's in a sort
of good-night salute and departed, shutting
the door behind her.</p>

<p>A moment later she opened it a crack.</p>

<p>"Don't lie awake thinking of him," she
said, "you know Conway wants breakfast
early."</p>

<p>Left alone at last, Denys gave a sigh of relief.
It was just like Gertrude to come up and make
arrangements not to be overworked! How
Conway would rage if he knew! And this
night of all nights in her life!</p>

<p>And then Denys forgot all about Gertrude,
and sitting on the rug in front of the fire gave
herself up to thinking of her happy future.</p>

<p>It was just like her mother to have lighted
a fire for her to sit and dream by. Mother
always seemed to think of little bits of comfort
to give people.</p>

<p>And she was engaged to be married!</p>

<p>She got up hurriedly, unlocked her desk
and took out a little pearl ring which had
been her mother's. In the firelight she slipped
it on to the third finger of her left hand, and
sat down again to contemplate it and all that
a similar ring given her by Charlie could mean!</p>

<p>And she would have to call Mrs. Henchman
Mother, and Audrey would be her sister!</p>

<p>Her eyes brimmed over with amusement.</p>

<p>What would they all say! Would they
be pleased and surprised&#8212;her grandmother
and Mrs. Henchman and Audrey? Had they
ever guessed at what Charlie had made up his
mind to three years ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. Henchman had seemed to like her then,
but then she had been an ordinary chance
visitor coming in for a cup of tea, the granddaughter
of Mrs. Henchman's old friend Mrs.
Marston. What would she think of her now
as her only son's future wife?</p>

<p>The fire was sinking down and Denys rose
and lit a candle and looked at herself critically
in the glass, and then she laughed into her own
face at the ridiculousness of the position. Who
would have believed that she, Denys Brougham,
on the evening of her engagement day, would
have been staring at her own reflection in the
glass, trying to find out what her future mother-in-law
would think of her!</p>

<p>And Charlie's words came back to her,
a fresh and tender memory to be treasured
for ever.</p>

<p>"I want to say something to you which I
have waited three years to say. I've loved
you ever since I've known you."</p>

<p>She slipped her mother's ring from her left
hand and put it away. She unbound her
bright brown hair with its curly waves, turned
by the candle light into a halo of red gold, and
laid a happy face upon her pillow.</p>

<p>Not a pretty, piquant face like Gertrude's,
quickly smiling or quickly clouded, but a
cheerful, reliable face with a pretty, good-tempered
smile and kind, gentle eyes; a face
that little children smiled back at, and which
invalids loved to see bending over them. But
the looking-glass did not tell Denys anything
of all that.</p>

<p>Upstairs in the so-called spare-room where
Tony slept, Charlie was standing at the tall
dressing chest trying to describe Denys to his
mother.</p>

<p>"I have got the berth I came for," he wrote,
"I'll tell you all about it when I come, and I
have got Denys! I'm so happy, mother
darling, I can't write about it, but she is the
prettiest, dearest, sweetest girl, and I know
you'll love her."</p>

<p>He could not think of any more to say and
he fastened his letter and opened his door a
crack. Seeing a light still in the hall, he crept
downstairs to find Conway just locking up.
He held up his letter with a smile.</p>

<p>"The midnight post?" asked Conway,
"not a love letter already!"</p>

<p>"It's to mother," answered Charlie simply.</p>

<p>"I'll show you the way," said Conway
politely. "I have my latch-key and it's a
lovely night."</p>

<p>It was not far to the post office, and the
two young men walked there and back
again in silence. Conway, always a silent
boy, could think of nothing to say. He felt
towards this stranger who, twenty-four hours
ago, had been nothing but a name to him, as
he might feel towards a burglar who had just
stolen his greatest treasure, and who yet had to
be treated with more than mere politeness
because he now belonged to the family&#8212;a
combination of feelings which did not tend
towards speech.</p>

<p>But Charlie was too engrossed in his happiness
to heed either silence or conversation. His
mind was busily planning out trains and times
for the next day's journey home. What would
be the last possible minute that he could give
himself at Old Keston?</p>

<p>They reached the house and Conway opened
the door with his key and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said.</p>

<p>Charlie's handshake was a hearty one.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" he said. "Good-night!
How long do you reckon it takes to walk to
the station?"</p>

<p>Conway smiled to himself as he put up the
bolts.</p>

<p>"I wonder," thought he, "I wonder if my
turn will ever come!"</p>
<br />
<br />

<h2><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h2>LOVE AND MONEY.</h2>
<br />
<br />

<p>"I think," said Charlie, looking across the luncheon table at Mrs.
Brougham. "I think that in about five weeks I could get a Friday to
Monday, and come down if you will let me&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," answered Mrs. Brougham, smiling back at the bright
open face opposite her. She really liked him very much, but she shared
something of Conway's feeling about the burglar. The idea that Denys
belonged in any sense to anybody else, needed a good deal of getting
used to.</p>

<p>She had certainly wondered once or twice in the last three years
whether young Henchman, who wrote so regularly to Denys, would ever
become more than a friend.</p>

<p>Charlie's telegram three days ago saying he had passed his final, and
was coming up from Scotland to see about a post and would call at St.
Olave's <em>en route</em>, had rather taken away her breath. His call
had been only a short one, but he had asked if he might return the
following day and tell them whether he had obtained the post.</p>

<p>He had duly returned&#8212;successful&#8212;with a good berth&#8212;with
prospects&#8212;with life opening out before him, and she had been
surprised at the gravity and anxiety that had shadowed his face even
when he spoke so hopefully of the good things that had come to him.</p>

<p>But the shadow and the gravity were all gone now. It was only his fear
that Denys would not see anything in him to love, that in the three
years in which he had worked, and hoped, and loved her, she might have
met someone else who was more worthy of her, and to whom she had given
the love he so longed to gain. That very evening he had put his fate
to the touch, over the nursery fire, while Denys waited to fetch away
Tony's light, and now he was bubbling over with fun and laughter,
and acting more like a big schoolboy than a sober young man who was
contemplating the cares of matrimony.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mrs. Brougham that the world had gone spinning round her
in an unprecedented manner in the last twenty-four hours, and she was
not sure whether she was on her head or her heels.</p>

<p>Suppose Conway&#8212;or Gertrude&#8212;why, Reggie Alston wrote to Gertrude as
regularly as the weeks went round!&#8212;or Willie&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>She gave herself a mental shake and scolded herself for letting
her head be turned with all these happenings. Why, Conway was only
nineteen and Gertrude just eighteen, and what would schoolboy Willie
say if she put him into such a line of possibilities!</p>

<p>She brought her thoughts back to the conversation round the table, and
found that Charlie was still in the full swing of plans.</p>

<p>"Easter will be four or five weeks after that," he was saying, "and I
shall get mother to have you down then, Denys&#8212;and Gertrude too," he
looked across at Gertrude&#8212;"and it will be so jolly, because I shall
get a whole week, I am sure, and we should have a lovely time. I'm
ever so glad mother has moved to Whitecliff; it won't be nearly such a
journey for you as Saltmarsh was."</p>

<p>Denys had opened her lips to reply, but before she could get out a
word, Gertrude had answered for her.</p>

<p>"That will be very nice," she said eagerly, "I always count to get a
holiday at Easter and I always want to go to the sea, whatever time of
year it is. It's very kind of you to ask me."</p>

<p>Charlie's eyes were on Denys. It was his first invitation to her to
his own home and she guessed that he felt a great happiness in it,
but how could she tell him that while Gertrude always took the Easter
holiday because of the school term, she herself always stayed at home
then, so that her mother should be sure of having one daughter to help
her&#8212;and Gertrude had already accepted the invitation!</p>

<p>Before she could frame any answer, a small voice chimed in.</p>

<p>"Maudie wants to go too! Maudie's got a spade and a pail."</p>

<p>There was a laugh all round the table, and Mrs. Brougham said, "My
dear child! Mrs. Henchman can't ask <em>all</em> the girls of St. Olave's!"</p>

<p>Her glance met Denys's, and Denys understood that it said, "Accept,
darling, I shall be all right!"</p>

<p>Denys looked up at Charlie and accepted the invitation with her own
sunny smile. "I feel dreadfully frightened, but I should love to
come," she said. "Oh, I do hope your mother will like me!"</p>

<p>"Like you!" echoed Charlie, and then he went crimson to the roots of
his hair. "<em>Like you</em>," he repeated half under his breath.</p>

<p>Easter was a long way off, and Denys thought very little more about
the proposed visit to Mrs. Henchman, and the present was very full and
very interesting. She decided to make some quiet opportunity to speak
to her mother about it, but before this opportunity could occur,
Gertrude took time by the forelock, as she always did when she was set
on a thing.</p>

<p>The two sisters were making marmalade in the kitchen on the morning
following Charlie's departure, when Gertrude brought her guns to the
attack.</p>

<p>"I say, Denys," she began, "it was very civil of Charlie to invite me
to Whitecliff. I saw you opening your mouth to say we could not both
go, so I just whipped in and accepted."</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can both go," said Denys gravely.</p>

<p>"No?" said Gertrude, raising her pretty eyebrows. "I suppose not! but
you had your chance, and went to grandma's for three months and picked
up a good match. Charlie is a very good match and he will be quite
comfortably off, and he is pleasant and good-looking and all that! Oh!
you have done very well for yourself, Denys, and you are not going to
prevent my having my chance."</p>

<p>Denys's cheeks were scarlet. She literally did not know what to say!</p>

<p>Had she made a good match? Had she done very well for herself? Such
a view of the case had never entered her head. She thought of what
Charlie's prospects had been when she first knew him on that long ago
visit to her grandmother.</p>

<p>Who would have said then that Charlie was likely to be comfortably
off? How well she remembered Gwyn Bailey's picnic, when Charlie had
told her that the positions he had hoped for were closed to him,
and that he had no money to enter a profession! She remembered the
hopeless ring of his voice as he had said, "now there's nothing."</p>

<p>No! she had not chosen Charlie for any such reason as Gertrude
suggested.</p>

<p>She was standing with her back to the scullery, and was quite unaware
that behind the half closed door Pattie was quietly peeling potatoes,
but her answer could scarcely have been different if she had known it.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not talk so, Gertrude," she said.</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Gertrude calmly, "people often do not care to hear
what is nevertheless quite true. And I mean to be pretty well off when
I get married, and not to have to scrape and think of every penny, and
wonder whether you can afford a new dress just directly you want it. I
think it's horrid, and I have always thought it horrid."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Denys, "it seems to me that we have been as happy at
home here as any family I know, even though we have had, as you call
it, to scrape and think of pennies, and manage our clothes and work
hard. I've liked it always and if I loved anyone I would not mind
being poor. Mother did not marry anybody rich and <em>she</em> is happy!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Gertrude, "it is all very well for you to talk. You have
Love <em>and</em> Money. And that's what I mean to have! So I shall go to
Whitecliff and get to know fresh people and see what turns up!"</p>

<p>"What about&#8212;&#8212;" began Denys, but she did not finish her sentence. She
disliked putting names together, but her thoughts flew off to a Scotch
town, where a boy with a merry face and dark twinkling eyes, was
working his hardest as a bank-clerk. Reggie Alston had been Gertrude's
chum since they were children, and he had never made any secret of the
fact that Gertrude was the one girl in the world in his eyes.</p>

<p>But Gertrude divined what Denys had meant to say, and with a light
laugh she went away to wash her sticky hands. She was not going to
have Reggie Alston thrown at her. Reggie was all very well and Reggie
might mean Love, but Reggie would not mean Money.</p>

<p>Turning to see what had become of Gertrude, Denys caught sight of
Pattie's interested face.</p>

<p>"I've got a young man, Miss Denys," she said importantly, "he's such
a nice, steady young man, Miss, your Mr. Henchman just reminds me
of him, and he's just as fond of me as anything, but"&#8212;her face
fell&#8212;"he's not very well off, Miss, not at all, and&#8212;and&#8212;well! it's
rather a pity, as Miss Gertrude's been saying, to marry poor."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pattie!" said Denys earnestly, "don't say that. If you love one
another, you can be so happy even if you are poor. If he is steady and
nice, that is much more important than being rich."</p>

<p>But Pattie's shake of the head was only the echo of Gertrude's words.</p>

<p>"Love <em>and</em> Money. Love <em>and</em> Money." "It's all very well for <em>you</em> to
talk."</p>

<h2>A GREAT BIG SHAME.</h2>

<p>"It's a shame! that's what it is, a downright shame," cried a woman's
voice angrily, "and it's just like you, Jim Adams, to put upon a poor
woman so. As if I had not enough trouble with one child, and you want
to bring your sister's brat here. I never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>Jim Adams stood with his broad back turned towards her, and he made no
reply.</p>

<p>"Yes! much you care!" she scolded, "but I tell you, Jim Adams, I won't
do it! You can write and tell your precious sister she can make other
arrangements. You are married now and you can't do just as you like;
you've got a wife, and I won't do it! There! you've waked the baby,
shouting at me about your sister; but I won't have anybody else's
child, so there!"</p>

<p>The lusty crying from the adjoining room continuing, she went in,
banging the door behind her, and Jim was left alone, staring doggedly
out at the tall houses opposite.</p>

<p>Should he write to his dying sister at Whitecliff and tell her to make
other arrangements? What other arrangements could she make? Could she
bring back her young sailor husband from his grave in the Red Sea?
Could she stay the progress of the cough, the outward sign of the
fatal sickness which was bringing her to an early death? Could she
send the child, her treasured little boy, to any other relative? Jim
knew she could not. Nellie and he had been alone in the world since
they were children. If he did not take little Harry, the boy must go
into the workhouse.</p>

<p>Should he tell Nellie that she must make that arrangement? He was an
easy-going chap, this Jim Adams, too easy-going. He stood six feet one
in his socks and was big and broad in proportion, a veritable giant in
looks, but his strength was mere physical strength, and he knew it. He
was not strong in himself. This was the very first time, since he
had known and courted Jane Green, that he had resisted her will for
twenty-four hours, and even now he was contemplating the possibility
of giving way.</p>

<p>Jane could make herself very disagreeable indeed if she were thwarted.
He had had nothing but storming since yesterday morning when Nellie's
letter had come, and he had had two half-cooked suppers and a
miserable cold breakfast. He did like a good supper, and if this was
what it was going to be if he had Harry&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>The sound of a gay voice singing on the pathway below, startled him.
There were always noises in the street, but this song caught his
attention.</p>

<p>Jim smiled grimly to himself; it was so absolutely true. Then his
wrath rose. What business had Jack Turner to be singing that ditty
under <em>his</em> window? He supposed all the neighbours laughed behind his
back at the way his small wife ruled him. If they only had a taste of
her nagging tongue they would not, perhaps, laugh so much. He would
let them see he was not under Jane's thumb!</p>

<p>He turned at the opening of the bedroom door, prepared to have his
say, and there was Jane with their big bouncing baby in her arms.
"Here!" she said crossly, "you just get this kid off to sleep, I'm
going for the supper beer. I've minded him all day, and I'm tired of
him. I believe he wakes up in the evening just to spite me!"</p>

<p>Jim took his baby and his eyes softened as he cuddled the little
fellow in his arms. He thought of Nellie's beseeching letter, and he
thought of himself as dead and of Jane as dead, and this baby left to
face a cold, unloving world. Would not Nellie have taken him? Would
she not have been a mother to him?</p>

<p>Oh! he knew she would. Nellie had been as a mother to himself ever
since they were children together.</p>

<p>Not for what the neighbours would say, nor for triumphing over Jane,
but for love's sake, he would take Nellie's child and be a father to
him.</p>

<p>That was settled finally, but Jane had gone for the beer and there was
no one to listen to his determination.</p>

<p>As he sat there rocking his baby, there was one sentence in Nellie's
letter that came back to his mind and disturbed it.</p>

<p>"Dear Jim, you'll teach my little Harry about our Saviour, won't you?
I've done my best, but children forget so quickly! Tell him that Jesus
Christ is our best Friend."</p>

<p>Our best Friend! A stab of pain shot through Jim's heart. Nellie's
best Friend, perhaps, but not his, not <em>our</em> best Friend, little
sister Nellie!</p>

<p>The baby dropped asleep, but Jane had not returned. She was no doubt
enjoying herself at the Green Dragon.</p>

<p>He rose and with the lamp in his disengaged hand, went into the
bedroom and laid the baby down, and covered him up warm.</p>

<p>He would make a cup of tea for himself, as Jane had not brought the
beer. He wished Jane would give up beer, she might be getting a bit
too fond of it, and he would give it up himself if she would.</p>

<p>He rather enjoyed making his tea and a couple of pieces of toast, and
setting it out neatly. His supper had left him unsatisfied in every
way.</p>

<p>As he poured out his first cup of tea there was a tap at the door, and
on his calling out, "Come in," a young fellow, so like Jane as to be
instantly recognised as her brother, entered.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said he.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Tom! What's brought you over to-night? Will you have a cup of
tea?"</p>

<p>"That I will!" said Tom. "Where's Jane?"</p>

<p>"Gone for the beer," said Jim shortly.</p>

<p>"You'd be a deal better off and a deal happier, both of you, if you
didn't take any of that stuff," said Tom. "It makes Jane quarrelsome,
I'm certain of it."</p>

<p>"I'd give it up if she would," said Jim valiantly. Then he added in a
shamefaced sort of way, "you see, when I do give it up for a bit, she
has it, and the smell and everything&#8212;well, I want it again!"</p>

<p>Tom nodded, gulped down his tea and set down his cup.</p>

<p>"You asked what brought me over," he said. "Pattie has given me up!"</p>

<p>"What!" demanded Jim incredulously, "given you up! Why?"</p>

<p>Tom's face worked. He was a simple-hearted fellow, and he loved
foolish little worldly-minded Pattie very dearly.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said unsteadily, "I believe it's money what's done it.
She was always so fond of me, was Pattie, and I thought she loved me
with all her heart, as I did her. But one of her young ladies has got
engaged to a gentleman as is pretty well off, and I s'pose&#8212;in fact,
Pattie allowed it was so&#8212;they got talking, as girls will, and it's
turned Pattie's head. 'She don't want to marry poor'&#8212;them's just her
words&#8212;and so she's&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Chucked you," said Jim grimly.</p>

<p>Tom sighed deeply. "I told her as my wage, though not big, was
reg'lar, winter and summer, and that was better than a big wage in
the summer and being out of work in the winter; and I don't drink&#8212;nor
smoke&#8212;and them two things makes a hole in any fellow's wages; but
there&#8212;talking ain't no good&#8212;argufying don't bring love. I suppose
she don't care for me and that's all about it." He reached out his cup
for more tea and gulped it down; it seemed to help him to gulp down
his feelings.</p>

<p>"I feel a bit done," he said after a minute's silence. "I'll be better
to-morrow. I never thought as how my love-making would end like this."</p>

<p>Jim got up and gave him a hearty thump on his back.</p>

<p>"Don't you be downhearted," he said, "you keep on steady and wait a
bit. You'll be seeing her looking downhearted soon, you mark my word,
and then you can step up and say, 'Is't me you want, my girl?' You're
a right down good fellow, Tom, and she don't know yet what she's
giving up."</p>

<p>Tom looked a little more cheerful. "You can tell Jane," he said,
rising to go.</p>

<p>"That's her on the stairs," answered Jim. "I'm going off to bed, so
you can stay and tell her yourself. She's out of sorts with me."</p>

<p>So Jane, with her jug of supper beer, found only her brother waiting
for her.</p>

<p>She greeted him effusively, and insisted on spreading the table afresh
with meat and bread and cheese, talking incessantly and laughing loud
and long as she did so, and Tom, knowing what it meant, wished he had
gone before her return.</p>

<p>But being there and having come on purpose, in a moment's lull in her
stream of talk, he told her about Pattie.</p>

<p>Her anger against Pattie was unbounded. She hugged Tom and called him
"poor dear," till he pushed her away, and then she said she would pay
the girl out. She would make her repent having used an honest fellow
like that! She was going into Old Keston on Monday for a day's
charring, and she knew well enough where Pattie lived. The garden of
the house where she worked ran down to Pattie's garden, and she would
give Pattie a bit of her mind.</p>

<p>"Then I hope you won't see her," said Tom. "I don't want any words.
Words won't make her care for me, and that's all I wanted."</p>

<p>He turned to the door, but Jane intercepted him with the jug of supper
beer.</p>

<p>"Have a glass, Tom, my lad! It'll comfort you and make you forget
your troubles. There's a deal of comfort in a glass when you're
low-spirited."</p>

<p>But the jug was struck from her hand and lay in twenty pieces on
the floor, and the beer ran hurriedly over the boards and sank away
between the crevices as if anxious to hide itself. "You <em>dare</em> to
tempt me!" said Tom hoarsely.</p>

<h2>A SMALL WORLD.</h2>

<br />
<p>"Does you want a boat?"</p>

<p>Such a soft, clear little voice! Denys turned quickly and looked up,
but her eyes had to come down again to the yellow sand on which she
sat. There was no one near enough to have spoken to her but a mite of
a boy in petticoats, with bare feet and yellow hair and brilliant blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the little voice again, "<em>does</em> you want a boat?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she answered with a tender smile; she had heard no
voice like this voice, since little Jerry died. It was as if Jerry
himself had come back to her.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't you want one?" insisted the child.</p>

<p>"I have no one to row me," she said.</p>

<p>He looked down at his little brown hands and then up in her face.
"When I'm a man I'll row you! I'm going to be a sailor like my dad
was!"</p>

<p>"What is your name, dear?"</p>

<p>"Harry! Harry Lyon!"</p>

<p>He stood with his little brown legs apart, gazing at her.</p>

<p>"My dad's dead! That's his grave," he said, with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"<em>Where?</em>" said Denys aghast.</p>

<p>He pointed to the dancing waves. "What colour does you call that sea?
Does you know colours?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p>"Why, yes! I know them. The sea is blue."</p>

<p>Harry shook his head unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"It's a red sea where my dad is?" he said.</p>

<p>"Where is your mother?"</p>

<p>Harry nodded inland, and a shadow fell over his sturdy little face.</p>

<p>"She's always coughing&#8212;she don't come out with Harry no more,"
he said, plaintively. Then his tone brightened. "She's going away
somewheres; she's going to get <em>quite</em> well&#8212;it's along of Jesus, our
best Friend&#8212;and I'm going with her," he added determinately.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Denys felt a great compassion for the little chap.
She wondered what would happen to him when mother got quite well, and
yet&#8212;with Jesus for best Friend&#8212;need she have wondered?</p>

<p>The child's next words effectually startled her out of her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Give us a penny!" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry! it's naughty to ask for pennies!"</p>

<p>"Give us a ha'penny then," he coaxed.</p>

<p>But Denys only shook her head and laughed at him, and at that moment
Gertrude and a young fellow sauntered up to her.</p>

<p>"We have had a lovely row!" exclaimed Gertrude gaily. "Mr. Greyburne
made the boat fly. It's such a little light thing, just made for two!
Where is Mrs. Henchman?"</p>

<p>"She was not feeling well enough to come out," answered Denys, "and
Audrey's school has not broken up yet."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you have been dull," said Cecil Greyburne politely; "but
you are going to cycle to Brensted Woods with us this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Denys ought not to be dull," said Gertrude easily. "She has letters
to write and to read, and she counts the hours till Charlie comes,
and she has to do the pretty to her future mother-in-law. You see, <em>I</em>
have not all these occupations. Denys! I am sure it is lunchtime!"</p>

<p>Denys rose and shook the sand from her dress.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Henchman wanted us all to walk to the Landslip this afternoon,"
she said. "She has ordered a donkey-chair and we shall have tea at the
Cottage. Could not you join our party, Mr. Greyburne? We can hardly
run away!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how horrid!" exclaimed Gertrude, "you know how I hate walking. I
shall get out of it somehow. Mr. Greyburne and I can cycle there and
join you at tea. How will that do, Mr. Greyburne?"</p>

<p>Cecil glanced at Denys, and his eyes passed on to Gertrude's merry,
sparkling face. She was really good fun to ride out with, and it
was turning out to be a much jollier Easter holiday than he had
anticipated. He did not exactly see why he should sacrifice himself
to walking beside a slow donkey-chair, when the prettiest girl he had
ever known invited him to a cycle ride. If she could get out of the
walk he was quite ready to second her. "I'll come up at any time
you name, and be ready for anything that is wanted of me," he said
gallantly. He felt he had handled a difficult decision very neatly.</p>

<p>As the two girls tidied their hair for lunch, Denys said very
earnestly,</p>

<p>"Gertrude! we really can't run away from Mrs. Henchman this afternoon;
it is not polite or&#8212;or&#8212;anything!"</p>

<p>"You can't, but I can," retorted Gertrude, "and I'm going to. You are
not going to condemn me to a slow walk when I can have a nice spin
with Cecil. I'll arrange it with Mrs. Henchman, and she'll be quite
satisfied if you don't interfere."</p>

<p>She ran downstairs and went gaily into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"So I hear you are going to take us all to the Landslip, and have
tea at the Cottage, Mrs. Henchman," she said, sitting down beside her
affectionately; "and Denys has asked Cecil Greyburne to go too, and
he and I are going to cycle instead of walk. Denys said you would not
like it, but I knew you would not mind."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Henchman answered as Gertrude had meant she should.</p>

<p>"Not at all, my dear! I want you to enjoy yourself while you are
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am!" answered Gertrude, very heartily and very truthfully. She
cast a little triumphant look at Denys. She was certainly enjoying
herself immensely. They had been at Whitecliff the larger half of a
week already, and Cecil Greyburne, an old school friend of Charlie's,
had dropped in to call on Mrs. Henchman the first evening, and since
then he had called in or met the girls constantly. Mrs. Henchman had
not been very well since their arrival, and Audrey was very engrossed
with the end-of-term examinations, and Gertrude found it convenient
to assume that Denys ought to be entertaining her future relatives
or writing to Charlie; she, therefore, monopolised Cecil to such an
extent, that every day it happened as it had happened that morning:
Denys sat alone on the beach or wandered about on the cliff, and
Gertrude, with a lightly uttered "Oh, Denys is busy somewhere," had
gone cycling or rowing or primrose hunting with Cecil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henchman had ordered her donkey-chair for three o'clock, and
shortly before that hour Gertrude came bustling in from the garden.</p>

<p>She found Denys in the hall collecting cushions and shawls, for though
the April sun was unusually warm there was a sharp touch in the wind.</p>

<p>"I say, Denys!" she exclaimed. "I have borrowed your machine&#8212;I have
bent my pedal somehow, and you won't want yours."</p>

<br />
<h2><a name="v" id="v"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h2>A WILD-GOOSE CHASE.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Donkeys are proverbially obstinate animals, and Mrs. Henchman's this
afternoon proved no exception to the rule. He had evidently made up
his mind that the road to the Landslip was not a congenial one. In
vain the boy who drove him cheered him onwards, in vain Denys tugged
at his bridle, in vain Audrey walked in front holding out an inviting
thistle. At length Mrs. Henchman got flurried and nervous.</p>

<p>"Boy!" she called, "what is your name?"</p>

<p>The boy turned a smiling round face, "Billy Burr, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Billy Burr! if you can't make your donkey go, I shall get out."</p>

<p>"If you please, ma'am," answered Billy Burr serenely, "it's
not my donkey. That's why he won't go, ma'am! It's Dickie Lowe's
donkey, but he's got a cold and he had to save up for to-night,
ma'am, to sing in the Stainer. Whoa&#8212;there&#8212;get on, you! That's
better!"</p>

<p>The donkey broke into a trot, and Denys
and Audrey and Billy were forced to do the
same, but in a minute that was over and the
donkey appeared to have recovered his right
mind and walked on stolidly. Billy and
Denys walking at his bridle fell into a confidential
chat.</p>

<p>"I told Dickie how it would be," Billy said
apologetically, "this one won't go for nobody
else and the other one was lame."</p>

<p>"Are you going to sing in Stainer's Crucifixion
to-night at All Saints'?" asked Denys
with interest. "I am going to hear it. Are
you one of the boys of All Saints'? One of
Miss Dolly Allan's boys?"</p>

<p>Billy nodded cheerily, "Do you know her?"
he inquired. "When is she coming down
again?"</p>

<p>But the donkey had come to a standstill,
and the party were forced to do the same.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly ridiculous going on like this,"
exclaimed Audrey. "We are a laughing stock
to the neighbourhood! Billy Burr, if that is
your name, why don't you give the animal
a good thrashing and <em>make</em> him go?"</p>

<p>"'Twouldn't be no use," said Billy vexedly.
"I'm real sorry, ma'am. Would you like to
try another road? It's just the road he's taken
offence at."</p>

<p>"No, indeed! the only road I shall go is
home again," cried Mrs. Henchman. "It's
too bad, though, to spoil all my afternoon
like this. Turn him round, boy, and let us get
back as fast as possible. It's a wasted afternoon."</p>

<p>"He'll go all right <em>that</em> way," said Billy.</p>

<p>"But what about Gertrude and Mr. Greyburne?"
said Denys as the little cavalcade
turned back. Oh, how she wished Gertrude
had been more amenable and had not broken
up the party.</p>

<p>"I am sure I should not trouble about
<em>them</em>," said Audrey walking on, "I don't know
why Gertrude did not stay with her hostess!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Mrs. Henchman, too worried
and annoyed to remember what she had said
to make it easy for Gertrude, "that is just
what I thought. Now, what is to be done? I
am not going home by myself with this donkey
for anybody."</p>

<p>Denys was ready to cry with vexation, and
yet as Gertrude and Cecil had been told to
wait at the cottage till they came, they could
not be left there indefinitely. She ignored
the remarks on Gertrude with what grace she
could, and tried to make the best of the
situation.</p>

<p>"We can all go back together," she said
soothingly, "and then I must go and find
Gertrude and tell her how unfortunate we have
been."</p>

<p>"You could cycle," suggested Audrey,
relenting a little.</p>

<p>Denys shook her head, "Gertrude has my
bicycle," she said; "something has happened
to hers. Oh, I can easily walk."</p>

<p>"Mine has gone wrong too," said Audrey.
"Look here, mother, surely I am capable of
taking you home. I've looked after you all
these years without help! If Denys has got
to walk she had far better go straight on."</p>

<p>"Whatever you like," said Mrs. Henchman
wearily. "I shall be truly thankful to be safe
back in my own bedroom. I shall have a heart
attack, I know! Go on, boy, at once!"</p>

<p>Denys stood and watched them out of sight,
the donkey going quite amiably now, and then
she turned to her own path. How tiresome it
was! and oh, how disagreeable to have got
into a bother with those she so much wished
to please, through no fault of her own.</p>

<p>But Charlie was coming down that evening,
and when he came everything would be all
right!</p>

<p>She trudged on cheerily after that, trying to
plan out the time between now and half-past
seven, when she was to meet Charlie at the
station, and they were to go together to hear
Stainer's Crucifixion sung at All Saints'.</p>

<p>It was wonderfully pretty in the Landslip,
though the trees were only just showing a green
tinge in the sunlight, but she hurried on as fast
as she could, and reached the cottage at last.</p>

<p>It was a pretty little ivy-clad cottage, with
a bench outside and a table set invitingly for
visitors, but the bench was unoccupied, and
she looked about in vain for any sign of Gertrude
or Cecil.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry she found that she was the
first visitor that afternoon. People had hardly
come down yet, the woman explained; they
generally came into Whitecliff this evening,
Thursday, and this was a favourite Good
Friday walk.</p>

<p>Denys sat down to wait and had not been
seated long, before the little voice that was so
like Jerry's, fell upon her ear.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said little Harry, peeping round
the door at her.</p>

<p>"How did you come here?" asked Denys,
but before she could get a reply, a sound of
terrible coughing came from within, and a
voice said, "Harry! Harry! you've left the
door open!"</p>

<p>Harry darted back, but returned very quickly.
He seemed to like talking to Denys, but
while she talked, Denys was watching for
Gertrude and listening to that rending cough.
Harry seemed to listen to it too. "That's
mother," he said, "aren't you coming to see
her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Denys shrinkingly, "she
would not like it."</p>

<p>Harry was off with his little petticoats flying,
and was back again like a flash.</p>

<p>"She wants you," he said triumphantly,
"she's been a-listening to your voice!"</p>

<p>He seized her hand, and led her into a little
room behind the parlour, and on a low bed by
the open window Denys saw a young woman
with a pretty face, so like Harry's as to proclaim
her his mother at once.</p>

<p>She looked up at Denys with a smile.</p>

<p>"Harry told me about you this morning,"
she said. "Won't you sit down, Miss? It
is very kind of you to come in."</p>

<p>Denys sat down. The window commanded
a view of the garden gate, so she was in no
danger of missing Gertrude. She wondered
whatever had become of her.</p>

<p>She found Mrs. Lyon very easy to talk to&#8212;and
while Denys and his mother chatted,
Harry climbed into the bed and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lyon looked down at him tenderly.</p>

<p>"It's hard to leave him," she said softly,
"oh, so hard! My brother, Jim, who lives
at Mixham Junction, has promised to take
him, but I don't know what his wife is like.
Jim don't never say much about her, and he'd
be sure to if she was the right one for him, but
Jim will be good to him, I know, and the Lord
Jesus is our best Friend and He is the Good
Shepherd. I often have to say that to myself
to comfort myself."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Denys, sympathetically, her
eyes on the almost baby face nestled on the
pillow, her thoughts busy with wondering
whether she could have left Jerry so trustingly
in God's care. And Jerry had been her brother,
not her child. She felt she could more willingly
have had Jerry die, than have died herself and
left him to other people to care for.</p>

<p>Her thoughts came back to the present
with a start. "Mixham Junction!" she said,
"that is only five miles from my home in Old
Keston!"</p>

<p>The sick woman's face flushed and she laid
her hand beseechingly on Denys's.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss!" she said, "would you&#8212;would
you sometimes&#8212;just sometimes go and see my
Harry, just to let them know there is somebody
as takes an interest, that he isn't quite
friendless, and you could remind him of Jesus?
I'm not sure about Jim's doing that. Would
you, Miss?"</p>

<p>Once more Denys looked at the little face,
and thought of Jerry.</p>

<p>"Yes!" she said, "while I am in Old Keston
or going there to see mother, and while Harry
is in Mixham, I certainly will."</p>

<p>Nellie Lyon's eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"I thank you from the bottom of my heart,"
she said.</p>

<p>Denys rose. A glance at her watch had
told her it was getting very late. What could
have become of Gertrude?</p>

<p>She went out once more. No one at all
like the missing couple had come. Indeed
she herself had been sitting in full view of the
gate for more than an hour. Already the sun
was sinking and the air was growing chill,
and a mist was gathering under the trees in
the Landslip. If she waited much longer she
would have a dreary enough walk under those
trees in the dusk. It was not a cheerful prospect,
and what would Charlie think if she were
not at the station to meet him?</p>

<p>That and the growing darkness decided her.
Hastily scribbling a note to be left with the
woman in case Gertrude and Cecil turned up,
she hurried away.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant walk. The sea sounded
mournfully at the foot of the rocks below her,
and the darkness under the trees was not
reassuring, and seemed to fall deeper each
moment. She wished she had taken the upper,
though much longer road, or that she had
started half an hour earlier and left Gertrude
and Cecil to their own devices. Even when
the moon, the great round moon, came up out
of the sea and shone through the trees upon her
path, it only seemed to make the shadows
blacker and more eerie, till she remembered that
it was the Easter moon, and thought of Him
who had knelt beneath the trees of Gethsemane
under that moon, on this night of His agony.</p>

<p>After that, thinking of Him, she did not feel
afraid, and at last she rang at Mrs. Henchman's
door.</p>

<p>Audrey ran out to open it.</p>

<p>"Well! I thought you were never coming!
Where are the others?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Denys, "I can't think."</p>
<br />

<hr style="width: 50%;" />
<br />
<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h2>A TICKET FOR ONE.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>As Cecil very justly observed to Gertrude, it
was a perfect afternoon for a ride, and the
two went gaily along the upper road to the
Landslip, till they came to a sign-post in a place
where four roads met.</p>

<p>Gertrude jumped off her machine and stood
gazing up at the directions indicated.</p>

<p>"You see!" she observed, "we have lots
of time before that slow donkey gets there.
We might make a detour and get into the road
again later on. We don't want to sit staring
down the Landslip till they arrive. Besides,
we've seen it all yesterday, haven't we?"</p>

<p>Cecil acquiesced. It amused him to see
Gertrude's cool way of arranging matters, and
it was certainly less trouble to be entertained
and directed hither and thither than to take
the initiative and entertain. At any rate it
was a change.</p>

<p>But bicycles, like donkeys, are not always
satisfactory means of locomotion. The pair
had not gone much further when Gertrude's
tyre punctured, and a halt was called while
Cecil repaired it.</p>

<p>Cecil was not a good workman; he made a
long job of it, and when at last they started
again, time was getting on and they had but
reached a small colony of houses when Gertrude
exclaimed that her tyre was down again.</p>

<p>She glanced round at the little cluster of
houses. "There's a cycle shop," she said,
"and a tea shop next door. How convenient.
We had better have the punctured tyre mended
for us and we can have tea while we wait!"</p>

<p>Cecil obediently wheeled her cycle into one
shop and followed her into the second.</p>

<p>He found her seated at a little table,
examining the watch on her wrist.</p>

<p>"Guess what the time is," she said laughing.
"Let us hope they won't wait tea for us at the
Landslip, for I am sure we shall never get
there! The woman here says there is no way
of getting there except by going back to the
cross-road!"</p>

<p>Cecil looked rather blank. He had not at
all counted on failing to keep the appointment
at the cottage, or on running the risk of thereby
offending Mrs. Henchman, and where would
be his promise to himself of making it up to
Audrey at tea-time?</p>

<p>However, the tea was already being placed
on the table, a plate of cakes was at his elbow,
and Gertrude was asking if he took milk and
sugar.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders mentally. "In
for a penny, in for a pound," he said to himself,
"here I am and I may as well enjoy myself."</p>

<p>So while Denys waited and watched for them
in the Landslip cottage, these two laughed
and ate and chatted and at last mounted their
bicycles and rode off back to Whitecliff in a
leisurely manner, arriving five minutes after
Audrey, dressed in her very best white frock,
had departed to her breaking-up school concert,
leaving Denys to hastily change her dress, eat
a much-needed tea and rush up to the station
to meet Charlie.</p>

<p>Gertrude came in with her usual easy manner.</p>

<p>"Well!" she said, "here we are! Where
is everybody? Did you think we were lost?"</p>

<p>"I am awfully sorry we missed," said Cecil
quickly. "The fact is we got into a road that
did not go there at all, and then Miss Gertrude
had a puncture, and then a second, and by
the time we got back to the right road we knew
it was too late to do anything."</p>

<p>Gertrude looked at the tea-table approvingly.</p>

<p>"I will ask you to tea, Cecil, as Denys does
not. Where is Mrs. Henchman, Denys?
You don't seem very communicative to-night."</p>

<p>"She is lying down till Charlie comes,"
said Denys. "We had a bother with the
donkey and it upset her. Audrey had to come
back with her and I went on to the Landslip
to find you. I have only just got back. Audrey
has gone to her concert; she was able to get a
ticket for you after all, and she said she was
sorry she could not wait for you, as she was
playing, but she would come and speak to
you in the interval."</p>

<p>Gertrude glanced at the ticket and tossed
it on to the table.</p>

<p>"I shan't go all by myself," she said, "I
shall go and hear the Stainer. I shall like it
much better; it is too utterly dull to sit by
one's self."</p>

<p>Denys's heart sank. She had so counted on
this treat alone with Charlie, and had secretly
been much pleased when Audrey and Gertrude
had planned to go to the concert together, and
now here she was saddled with Gertrude's
company. Besides, what would Audrey say?</p>

<p>She poured out the tea and as she put milk
into the third cup, she almost smiled.</p>

<p>She had forgotten Cecil! Of course, though
there was but one ticket for the concert, there
were no tickets needed for the Church!</p>

<p>But she herself must start for the station
almost immediately, and the Service of Song
was not till eight o'clock. She must leave the
couple behind her, and then if Gertrude
changed her mind again and stayed at home
after all, what <em>would</em> Mrs. Henchman think
when she came downstairs and found them
amusing themselves over the drawing-room
fire?</p>

<p>Somehow since she came to Whitecliff, Denys
had felt bewildered and out of touch with God,
and had forgotten her usual habit of praying
about the little everyday worries and perplexities;
but now suddenly, fresh from the
walk under the moonlit trees which had
reminded her of Gethsemane, as she stood with
the teapot in her hand, she bethought her of
the words, "God is our refuge and strength, a
very present help in trouble," and with the
remembrance of Him, came the suggestion of
what she had better do.</p>

<p>She would run up and say good-bye to
Mrs. Henchman and tell her what they were
all planning for the evening, and then the
responsibility would be no longer on her
shoulders.</p>

<p>And even as she decided this, Cecil looked
up from a perusal of Audrey's concert
ticket.</p>

<p>"If neither of you want this ticket," he said,
"I think I will take it. I would like to hear
Audrey play, and she will feel it dull if there
is nobody there that she knows."</p>

<p>Denys looked up gratefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" she said. "I was
afraid she would be very disappointed to see
no one. That is really kind."</p>

<p>Gertrude pouted openly.</p>

<p>"Look here, Denys!" she said, "mind you
and Charlie look out for me!"</p>

<p>That little touch of God's hand had made
all the difference to Denys.</p>

<p>"All right," she said cheerfully, "we will
do our best."</p>

<p>She ran lightly upstairs and knocked softly
at Mrs. Henchman's door.</p>

<p>She found Mrs. Henchman lying on her sofa
beside a bright little fire, and after telling her
their plans, she bent down and kissed her
affectionately.</p>

<p>"Shall you be lonely with us all out?" she
asked solicitously.</p>

<p>"I daresay I shall be all right, my dear,"
Mrs. Henchman replied, a little grudgingly. This
weakness which had come upon her in the last
few months was a sore trial&#8212;not an accepted
trial&#8212;under which she chafed and fretted day
by day.</p>

<p>Denys longed to be able to say, "I will
gladly stay and keep you company," but then
Charlie had arranged this evening's engagement
and she knew Mrs. Henchman would
not allow it to be altered.</p>

<p>Instead, she said, "Will Mary come up, and
see if you want anything?"</p>

<p>"I really can't say, my dear. Mary is a
funny person. Run along now or you will be
late for Charlie."</p>

<p>Denys left her, but as she passed down the
stairs she saw the kitchen door ajar, and with
a sudden impulse she tapped at it.</p>

<p>"Mary!" she said, "we are all going out.
You will take care of Mrs. Henchman, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss!" Mary's tone and face were
indignant. "I always <em>do</em> take care of Mrs.
Henchman."</p>

<p>Denys retreated.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said to herself as she closed
the front door behind her. "I am afraid I
have made a mistake."</p>
<br />
<br />
<hr style="width: 50%;" />
<br />
<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h2>HEIGHTS AND DEPTHS.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>It seemed to Denys as if she had never felt
so absolutely happy, so blissfully content, as
she did when with Charlie's arm tucked into
hers, they left the station together and made
their way down the steep hill to the church.</p>

<p>All the worries of the day and the worries
of the yesterdays had slipped from her, and
not even the thought of Gertrude, awaiting
them in the church porch, had power to disturb
her.</p>

<p>Charlie and she were together, and before
them stretched the days, the hours, the minutes,
the seconds of a whole week! A whole, long,
lovely week, of which only five minutes had
already gone! Charlie's voice, his dear, familiar
voice, though it only spoke of the trivialities
of his journey, seemed like music to her. She
did not know how her heart had hungered for
him, till she felt how satisfied she was now in
his presence.</p>

<p>They reached the church before she thought
it possible; Gertrude was not in the porch,
and Denys paused a moment in the doorway
and glanced about for her. Yes! there she
was, some distance down the aisle, comfortably
ensconced between Mrs. Henchman's medical
man, Dr. Wyatt, and his sister, and as Denys
descried her, she turned her pretty face to
answer some remark of the doctor's and caught
sight of Denys and Charlie, and her smile and
shake of the head were easily translated.</p>

<p>"She is not going to sit with us," said
Charlie, "so <em>that's</em> all right."</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o'clock, and Denys, full
of her happy thoughts, let her eyes wander
round the church, noting its pillars, its high
arched roof, its electric lights, and the ever-increasing
crowd which moved softly up the
aisle till every seat that she could see was
occupied.</p>

<p>And then came the choir. She watched
their faces eagerly. Would she recognise Billy
Burr? And which was Dickie Lowe? Ah!
those two must be the golden-haired twins
about whom Mr. Owen had told her and Charlie
three years ago, now no longer the foremost in
the little procession, but as unknowable apart
as ever, as they preceded the tenors. And
there, behind all, was Mr. Owen's familiar face!
Denys knelt with all the congregation, waiting
and longing to hear his deep, strong voice in
the collects which began the service. But it
was a curate who read the prayers, and the
words passed unheeded over Denys's head, for
her heart was back in Saltmarsh among the
days when she had first known Mr. Owen and
Charlie.</p>

<p>So the music began and a voice rose
plaintively&#8212;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="And they came">
<tr><td align='left'>"And they came to a place called Gethsemane."</td></tr>

<p>The words came into the midst of Denys's
wandering thoughts with a startling suddenness.
She saw again the darkness gathering
under the trees, the black shadows of the
bushes and the Easter moon above!</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="How the voice">

<p>How the voice rang down the church!</p>

<p>What had she come there for?</p>

<p>To think of Charlie&#8212;of her happiness? She
could have stayed at home to do that.</p>

<p>Was it for the music she had come? No,
for mere music she would not have come out
on this first evening of Charlie's return.</p>

<p>For what had she come then?</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="How the voice">
<tr><td align='left'>"Could ye not watch with Me one brief hour?"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The tender words stole down into the depths
of her heart and stirred it to a tenderness that
she had never felt for her Saviour before. She
seemed, as the organ sounded out the Processional
to Calvary, to be one of the crowd
gathering round the lonely figure in the Via
Dolorosa, and to be passing out through the
gates of the city with the triumphant song&#8212;</p>

<p>The triumph of it, and the humiliation of it

<p>So with her eyes on His face, her feet following
His pathway of sorrow, forgetful of all else,
she went on with Him to the end.</p>

<p>It was over!</p>

<p>The congregation passed out again under
the starlit, moonlit sky, and left the church
with the words&#8212;</p>

<p class="noindent">still echoing softly amid the arches of the roof.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;" />

<p>It was a very bright and lively party that
sat round Mrs. Henchman's supper-table that
night. Mrs. Henchman, with Charlie beside
her, seemed brightest of all, and yet Denys
fancied&#8212;was it only fancy?&#8212;that when her
hostess spoke to her or glanced at her, there
was a coldness in her voice and glance that
she had not seen before. Audrey divided her
attentions between her brother and Cecil Greyburne,
with whose appearance at the concert
she had been much gratified; but as the meal
progressed, Denys began to notice that Audrey
did not by any chance speak to her, and kept
her eyes studiously in another direction.</p>

<p>A shadow fell over Denys's happiness, but
she drove it away with her usual good-tempered
large-mindedness. This was the first time that
Mrs. Henchman and Audrey had had to realise
that Charlie was no longer exclusively their
own, and of course they felt that she was the
cause! They would be all right to-morrow.</p>

<p>But when Mary came in to clear the supper,
Denys began to think that there might be
something more than that the matter, for
Mary's indignant and lowering look at her
suddenly reminded her of that unfortunate
moment in the kitchen before she started out
to meet Charlie. She grew hot all over. Surely
Mary could not have taken serious offence at
what she had said!</p>

<p>She had no opportunity to do more than
think of the possibility, before she found herself
politely but unceremoniously hustled off to
bed, and as she and Gertrude left the drawing-room,
an unconscious backward glance showed
her Mrs. Henchman cosily pulling forward a
couple of armchairs to the fireside.</p>

<p>Well! it was natural, of course.</p>

<p>Up in her room she began laying away her
hat and jacket and putting out the dress she
would need in the morning, when, after a
hasty knock, Audrey entered, and carefully
closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>"Look here, Denys," she said, a little breathlessly,
"I have come up to say that I do think
it is too bad of you to go upsetting our servant.
When I came home I found mother in an
awful state&#8212;perfectly awful&#8212;and all through
your interfering with Mary, and telling her to
take care of mother! Of course, Mary did not
like it, and poor mother had to bear it all alone.
It <em>is</em> a shame."</p>

<p>So Mary had not taken care of Mrs. Henchman,
but had gone up and complained of
Denys. That much was clear!</p>

<p>It did not help Denys that she could see
Gertrude, as she brushed out her long, dark
hair, shaking with suppressed laughter, but
before she could think of anything to say to
defend herself, Audrey had begun again.</p>

<p>"I never thought we should have an interfering
daughter-in-law," she said. "You are
not Mrs. Henchman <em>yet</em> to give orders to our
servant! Mother is awfully annoyed, and as
to Charlie&#8212;&#8212;!"</p>

<p>Denys drew herself up a little.</p>

<p>"I think, Audrey," she said coldly, "that
quite enough has been said about this. I had
not the faintest thought of being interfering.
I only spoke to Mary as I should have thought
any visitor in my home might speak to our
maid, if mother were alone and ill. And I
think that it would have been more suitable
if your mother or Charlie had spoken to me
themselves about it. I will tell them to-morrow
how very, very sorry I am your mother has
been upset."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you will do nothing of the
kind," cried Audrey. "Do let her forget it,
if possible, poor thing! And as for Charlie,
<em>of course</em>, mother does not annoy him with
worries the first five minutes he is in the house,
and why should he be made angry? as he would
be if he knew. Pray let the whole matter
drop."</p>

<p>Denys was silent, and Audrey went away,
shutting the door noisily.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Gertrude, when her footsteps
had died away, "now I may laugh in peace!
I don't congratulate you on the tempers of
your future relations, Denys." But Denys
was too utterly overset to attempt defence or
condemnation. Great tears welled up into her
eyes and rolled down her cheeks as fast as she
wiped them away. She was glad that Gertrude
took her side, but she felt that Gertrude's own
vagaries had helped not a little, in the avalanche
of blame which had fallen upon her head.</p>

<p>She could not go to sleep. She lay in the
darkness, her pillow wet with those great tears
which she could not seem to stop, her mind
going backwards and forwards over it all
unceasingly, in a maze of useless regrets and
annoyance, until suddenly a melody she had
heard that evening seemed to float into her
mind.</p>

<p>Ah, there was rest there!</p>

<p>To the rhythm of the soft, soothing melody
she fell asleep.</p>

<br />
<h2><a name="viii" id="viii"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h2>IN FEAR.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Denys rose the next morning pale and heavy-eyed.
Charlie and she had arranged overnight
to be out at seven to take an early stroll on the
sea front, and as she dressed, Denys's thoughts
were busy with how she should meet everybody,
and how much or how little it was best to say
about last night's cause of offence.</p>

<p>She was somewhat startled to find Gertrude's
bright eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"My dear Denys!" said she, "if you don't
want to be the first to tell Charlie of this ridiculous
affair, don't go down with that face!
Look as happy as you did last night, or he
will be asking questions."</p>

<p>Denys coloured faintly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do about it," she
sighed.</p>

<p>"If you don't want a thing talked about,
don't talk about it," answered Gertrude sagely.
"If ever I am engaged and my <em>fianc&#233;'s</em> relations
try sitting on me, I shall soon show them that
it is a game two can play."</p>

<p>She stopped to laugh at some secret remembrance,
and Denys's thoughts flew once again
to that far-off Scotch town and the dark-haired
boy with merry, twinkling eyes. Not a very
auspicious remark for Reggie, who had neither
father nor mother, sister nor brother!</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I was laughing at,"
pursued Gertrude, who was most wonderfully
wide awake and talkative this morning. "Do
you remember Reggie's getting me a ticket to
see the King give the medals for the South
African War, at the Horse Guards? Reggie's
cousin had a medal, you know. It was rather
a crush, and of course Reggie wanted us to be
in a good place, and we certainly were. Well,
behind me there was a big stout woman, and
oh! how she leant on me&#8212;just on my shoulders!
I shall never forget the feel of it! At last I
got perfectly tired of it and I thought of a
plan. She was stout and soft and broad,
and I just leant right back on her&#8212;on her chest.
It was simply <em>restful</em>. After a bit, of course, I
stood up properly, when I had got over the
tiredness a little!"</p>

<p>"My dear Gertrude." Denys's laugh rang
out involuntarily.</p>

<p>"She did not try that little dodge again,"
said Gertrude, laughing too. "Denys, don't
put on that horrid red blouse."</p>

<p>"But I've nothing else!" objected Denys.</p>

<p>"Nothing else! Why, there's that sweet
white nun's veiling. I've wanted 'the fellow
to it,' as Grandma used to say when she did
not wish to covet her neighbour's goods, ever
since you made it. Put that on and astonish
the natives and be done with it!"</p>

<p>Denys lifted out the white blouse obediently.
It certainly suited her, and her laugh at Gertrude
had brought a colour into her cheeks. She
suddenly guessed that Gertrude had waked
herself up on purpose to amuse her and change
her thoughts and she bent quickly over the
pillow and gave Gertrude's soft cheek a grateful
sisterly kiss.</p>

<p>"Now shall I do?" she asked, straightening
herself up.</p>

<p>"Ar," said Gertrude emphatically. "Now!"
mimicking Denys's own tone, "don't be late
for breakfast, my dear."</p>

<p>And Denys ran downstairs smiling! Gertrude
<em>had</em> got pretty, entertaining ways. It was no
wonder people liked her.</p>

<p>Charlie was waiting for her in the hall.</p>

<p>"You look as bright as the morning," he
said; "isn't it delicious to be out so early?"</p>

<p>They strolled up and down the empty parade,
enjoying themselves immensely, though every
now and then a sickening fear of what the
approaching breakfast hour might bring, swept
over Denys. But she determined to stick to
Gertrude's advice and say nothing to anyone
unless positively obliged.</p>

<p>They turned homeward at last, and as they
caught sight of the church tower, Charlie said,</p>

<p>"What did you think of doing this morning?"</p>

<p>Denys's eyes looked eager, but she thought
of Mrs. Henchman and the two armchairs over
the fire last night, and she hesitated to produce
a plan that would monopolise Charlie for herself.</p>

<p>"What would you like?" she said.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought that you and I, at any
rate, would go to church together this morning.
The others, of course, must choose for themselves,
but I should not feel happy to do anything
else myself."</p>

<p>Denys's eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," she said, "that is just what
I wished."</p>

<p>"Mother told me about the donkey," pursued
Charlie. "Poor mother, it quite put her about!
So I told her I should hire a nice little wicker
bath chair and I should push her, and we would
all go to the Landslip this afternoon and have a
nice walk together. Only we'll start at two,
while the sunshine lasts, and we can get Cecil
and one or two more to join us."</p>

<p>"That will be lovely!" said Denys, "and I
will see that poor Mrs. Lyon and little Harry.
Oh, I wish I had bought some grapes yesterday.
I absolutely forgot that the shops would be
shut."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'll get you some," said Charlie.
"I know the back door of a greengrocer's
shop, and I'll go and thump till he opens
it."</p>

<p>They were in excellent time for breakfast,
and so was Gertrude; but Denys found the
meeting of her offended friends was to be an
agony long drawn out, for Mrs. Henchman
had sent down word that she should breakfast
in bed, and that Charlie might wait upon her.
Audrey was already seated behind the teapot
with an aggressive little air which seemed to
say, "Behold the daughter of the house," but
with Charlie's eyes upon her she greeted Denys
at least civilly, and she and Gertrude appeared
to be on the best of terms.</p>

<p>By-and-by Cecil Greyburne turned up, and
Denys left the three deep in discussion over
the morning's plans, and went to get ready
for church, calling in on Mrs. Henchman on
her way upstairs.</p>

<p>She found her dressed on her sofa, with
Charlie in an arm-chair on the opposite side of
the fire; she stayed a minute or two with
them and went on to her room, feeling glad
that the first meeting with Mrs. Henchman
was over and nothing had been said. Oh,
if she could only know that nothing more
<em>would</em> be said! Then she could try and go on
cheerfully and endeavour to forget that anything
disagreeable had happened.</p>

<p>She and Charlie found All Saints' far more
crowded than they had anticipated, the result
being, that as they waited with many others in
the aisle, Denys found herself put into a row
where there was but one seat, and she could
only look helplessly on while Charlie was
marched by the verger, who knew him but
did not know Denys, right up to the front.</p>

<p>Yet, after the first moment of chagrin,
Denys felt a vague relief in being alone. Alone,
in a crowd, with no eyes upon her that knew
her, alone with herself and God.</p>

<p>The prayers, the familiar Sunday prayers
seemed to have a new significance on this day,
under the very shadow of the cross on which
He hung, for Whose Name's sake she asked
forgiveness and blessing.</p>

<p>The Psalms, the anguished cry of the Crucified,
sounded solemnly out, the very words
of His lips, the awful loneliness of His heart,
the unshaken faith in His God.</p>

<p>The lessons, the hymns, all told the same
story, that the Father sent the Son to be the
Saviour of the world, that now once in the end
of the world, hath He appeared to put away
sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</p>

<p>The text, again so familiar, so significant on
this day, floated out through the church.
This was the way&#8212;the truth&#8212;the life&#8212;indeed.</p>

<p>"He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement
of our peace was upon Him, and with
His stripes we are healed."</p>

<p>It seemed as if the sermon, so gentle, so
simple, so tender, held in it no human words
and yet it was not a mere repetition of verse
upon verse of Scripture.</p>

<p>As Denys sat with her eyes rivetted on
Mr. Owen's face, she felt as if she had never even
guessed before at the depth of Christ's salvation,
that she had only touched the fringe of the
knowledge of the love of Christ which passeth
knowledge.</p>

<p>She rose with the congregation and sang it
with her whole heart, sang it through its verses
till they came to the fourth verse, and she sang
that, too, thinking not so much of its words
as of the love she felt for that Prince of Glory&#8212;</p>

</table></div>

<p>Her soul&#8212;her life&#8212;how gladly she gave them
once more to Him for his service!</p>

<p>And then&#8212;in one instant&#8212;she came back
to the things of earth, and so to another thought&#8212;her
all! A movement about her had brought
Charlie into her view. She saw him before
her with a ray of sunlight resting across his
fair head.</p>

<p>Her all! The whole realm of nature, in her
eyes! She remembered again the blissful
content, the undreamed of happiness, his
presence had brought to her yesterday. She
remembered with a shiver how that perfection
of joy, which had seemed so unassailable, had
been shattered in a moment by a word of her
own, which had given offence where none was
meant, by a care for others which had been
resented.</p>

<p>She knew in a flash that the cause of her
unending tears, of her heart-sickness ever
since, had been the fear of Charlie's anger,
the fear that, be the reason great or small,
she should forfeit his affection and cease to be
all the world to him.</p>

<p>She did not stop to think how much she was
wronging Charlie's faithful love. She was
oblivious for the moment of everything but
this fear. She had been fighting fiercely since
last night against the bare thought of the
possibility of losing Charlie's love; she had
been holding on to that love as for her life, and
now another love, a love higher, wider, deeper
the love that passeth knowledge, had risen up
before her and claimed&#8212;her all.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Were the whole">
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: .5em;">Were the whole realm of nature mine,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">That were an offering far too small.</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The thoughts passed through her mind with
the swiftness of a dream, as, instinctively
following the movements of those about her,
she stood there with her eyes fixed upon Charlie,
while the slow procession of the choir filed out
and the organ sounded plaintively among the
high arches.</p>

<p>She seemed only to see Charlie&#8212;her all&#8212;the
whole realm of nature which at that moment
she <em>did</em> possess&#8212;how the thought thrilled her&#8212;she
saw him on one side and her crucified
Saviour waiting on the other.</p>

<p>Waiting&#8212;for what?</p>

<p>Her soul&#8212;her life? She had given them.
Ah! for something more&#8212;her all! The congregation
around her were passing out. She
sank slowly on to her knees and hid her face.
The Love which had given its all for her had
conquered.</p>

<p>With her all, she knelt at His feet, and
kneeling there she broke her box of ointment
of spikenard, very precious, and poured it out.</p>

<p>The church was almost empty when she
rose and passed out. Charlie was waiting for
her in the porch, and Audrey, Gertrude and
Cecil were on the steps. Audrey slipped her
arm into Denys's. "Wasn't it nice? Didn't
you like it?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Very much, oh, very much!" Denys
answered. "I did not know you were all
there."</p>

<p>She gave her arm a little answering
pressure. This was the Audrey she had known
at Saltmarsh!</p>

<p>"That was Cecil," said Audrey gravely.
"He said that when there were so many who
<em>didn't</em> care, we, who do care, ought to show
that we cared! So, of course, we went."</p>

<p>When the afternoon came, it was a pleasant
and united little party which set out for the
walk to the Landslip. As Gertrude observed
serenely&#8212;</p>

<p>"With neither donkeys nor bicycles we ought
to do quite nicely!" and quite nicely they did,
Mrs. Henchman arriving in such good condition
and spirits that she proposed walking a short
distance to see the view while tea was being
got ready.</p>

<p>Denys held up the little basket of grapes
Charlie had given her.</p>

<p>"I will take these in to Mrs. Lyon while you
are gone," she said.</p>

<p>She tapped softly at Mrs. Lyon's door, and
before any answer came, the woman with
whom she had left her note on the previous
day, opened her kitchen door with a scared
look in her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss!" she said. "Oh, Miss! don't
tell any one, but she's gone! Poor dear, she's
gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone!" echoed Denys.</p>

<p>The woman burst into low, restrained weeping.</p>

<p>"The visitors mustn't know," she sobbed.
"They are afraid of death, but I've been
longing and hoping for you all day, Miss.
Poor dear, poor dear, she died last night."</p>

<h2><a name="ix" id="ix"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h2>BROTHERS-IN-LAW.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>The news of his sister Nellie's death came
upon Jim Adams with the suddenness of a
thunderclap. The weeks had gone by since
she wrote to ask him to take Harry, with no
further news of her, and after watching every
post for a few days in the expectation of a
black-edged envelope, he had begun to think
that it was only a scare, and that she was not
going to die at all, and it was really a pity that
he had had all that bother with Jane!</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of this feeling, the incident
had done him good in more ways than one.</p>

<p>He had fought for duty instead of running
away from it. He had been reminded of
things which he had hardly wanted to remember.
He had been strengthened for the right by
the mere fact that somebody never dreamed
but that he would do right.</p>

<p>Also he had taken Tom's advice, and had had
what Jane deridingly called "a teetotal spell,"
the result of which was a respectable banking
account which perfectly astonished him. He
had no idea small sums could total up so.</p>

<p>The idea of saving a little money had come
to him from one of Jane's harangues, in which
she informed him that when "that brat"
came, she did not intend to spend any of her
housekeeping money upon him; Jim would
have to give her more. She was quite short
enough as it was, especially with a great romping
baby of her own, and she supposed that Jim
would be sorry to see <em>him</em> getting thin and
pale and perhaps dying altogether, because
somebody else's child ate the food that ought
to have been in his mouth. And then the
funeral! Funerals cost a lot!</p>

<p>With this interesting climax Jane went to
get the supper beer&#8212;out of the housekeeping&#8212;and
Jim made his cocoa, and thought things
over.</p>

<p>Not that he discussed Harry's coming with
her. He had never mentioned the subject
since that first night. He disliked words, and
he found Jane tired of rating more quickly
without an answer, though sometimes he could
not resist giving one, but he always wished
afterwards he had held his tongue.</p>

<p>He determined, as he sipped his cocoa, that
he would accept some over-time work, which
he had happily not mentioned to Jane, and
save up what he earned and add it to his beer-money
in the bank. Who could tell when it
might be wanted?</p>

<p>So the telegram telling of Nellie's death
found him unprepared in one way&#8212;prepared
in another.</p>

<p>He proposed to go down and attend the
funeral and bring Harry back, but Jane was
furious. He had promised to take her and
the baby down to her mother's for the Easter,
and she did not mean to go by herself, as if
she had no husband, and if Jim spent the
money on train fares to Whitecliff and board
and lodging as well, where was the money for
going home to come from? Besides, what
good would it do? Nellie was dead, and the
brat could come up with the guard. Anyhow,
Jim had no black clothes!</p>

<p>That last argument was unanswerable. So
Jim wrote to Nellie's friends and said he could
not come to the funeral, and asked them to
arrange for Harry to come up with the guard
and to let him know the day and the train,
and he would meet him.</p>

<p>Then with a rather heavy heart, he shouldered
Jane's parcel and his big baby, and took the
Easter excursion train into Suffolk.</p>

<p>It was very late on the Saturday night
when they reached their destination, for the
train was two hours behind time, but the
welcome they received in the tiny cottage had
suffered nothing from its delay.</p>

<p>Old Mr. and Mrs. Green's delight over their
first grandchild was quite astonishing, and
they admired him from the curl on the top of
his round head to the sole of his little fat foot.</p>

<p>And there, in the chimney corner, looking
thin and worn, sat Tom.</p>

<p>Jim grasped his hand warmly.</p>

<p>"Well! I <em>am</em> glad you're here," said he,
"it will be a bit of company." He glanced
back at the group round the baby and Tom
nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>"I had nothing to keep me," he said quietly.</p>

<p>It was a long, long time since Jim had been
to church, but he found that on this Easter
Sunday morning, Mr. and Mrs. Green expected
nothing else. Jane elected to remain at home
and mind the baby and cook the dinner, and
the old couple, with their stalwart son-in-law
on one side and Tom on the other, found themselves
places in the old village church.</p>

<p>It was all very quiet and nice, Jim thought.</p>

<p>His heart was sore for his little sister Nellie
and he felt alone in the world, cut off from all
his childhood, all that they two had shared
together.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to Jane to offer him
any sympathy in his loss. She had hardly
realised the loss, only the coming of a burden.
And in not going to the funeral, Jim had an
odd feeling of neglecting Nellie, though his
common sense told him it could make no
difference to her.</p>

<p>The Easter hymns comforted him strangely.
His mind seemed to pass from the earthly
grave to the heavenly Resurrection with a
thrill of hope that matched with the sunshine,
the bursting of green leaves, the twitter of the
birds and the blue sky above.</p>

</table></div>

<p>And so he came to another thought. Was <em>he</em>
going to meet Nellie?</p>

<p>He glanced across at Tom. The quiet
patience of his face touched him. Tom had
lost something too. Something more hopeless,
more irremediable than even the death of a
sister, and yet there was a strength in his look
which seemed to Jim not to be of earth, but
from above. Tom and Nellie were on one
side, and he, Jim, was on another.</p>

<p>The two young men went for a walk together
in the afternoon, and it was like Tom to be the
first to touch on Jim's sorrow.</p>

<p>"You're wearing a black tie, Jim," he said.</p>

<p>So Jim told him all about Nellie, his pretty
little gentle sister Nellie, and then of her child
and of how he had promised to take him, and
look after him, but he did not mention Jane.
After all, Jane was Tom's sister.</p>

<p>Tom listened gravely. There was sympathy
in the very way he listened, and Jim felt it.
He longed to ask Tom if he approved of his
taking Harry, but some of the strength which
had grown in him since his decision, kept him
silent. He <em>had</em> decided and what was the use
of courting disapproval. But Tom was not
one to withhold commendation, of which there
is so little in this world's intercourse, and he
gave his verdict unasked.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did," he said heartily, "poor
little chap, what else could you do? It's quite
right. Mind you, Jim, any time if you are
pushed with him, there's always a bed and meal
with me. I've more than enough for myself."</p>

<p>That was Jim's opportunity, and he took it.</p>

<p>"You're a good sort, Tom," he said, "I'll not
forget. How&#8212;how&#8212;" he hesitated. "Have
you seen Pattie since?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom sadly, "I've seen her."</p>

<p>There was a finality in his answer that Jim
did not like to break, and they walked on in
silence till Tom spoke again.</p>

<p>"I saw her," he said, "when she didn't see
me, and I thought she looked tired-like. She
was with some girl, a loud-voiced, gay-looking
sort of girl, who must have known me, though
I don't know her; and when she saw me, she
whispered to Pattie and laughed, and Pattie
tossed her head and laughed out loud, as I
never heard her laugh before, and she went red,
but she never turned her head nor looked, not
even when she got to the corner, for I stood
and watched. I couldn't turn my back and
leave her. I <em>had</em> to look while she was in
sight."</p>

<p>"Is there&#8212;is there any&#8212;&#8212;?" Jim stopped.</p>

<p>"Is there anybody else?" said Tom in a
strangled kind of voice. "They say so. The
butcher's man, in that big shop by the Station
Hotel. He looks smart and dresses like any
gentleman on a Sunday, but he's always popping
in and out of the hotel, and if you could hear
his language&#8212;"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be too sure of what 'they
say'," said Jim, "and as for her laughing and
all that&#8212;p'r'aps it was just put on because
you were looking. It made her feel awkward-like.
If she hadn't cared a bit, she'd have
gone on without turning a hair."</p>

<p>Tom sighed.</p>

<p>"I'd wait a bit and take no heed of what
folks say about her," went on Jim, "and
then if you find you keep on caring, just up
and ask her again. You've as much right as
any other man. When she gets to know this
fellow better, she'll know what she's missed."</p>

<p>Tom smiled faintly and the shadow in his
eyes lightened a little at Jim's hopefulness.</p>

<p>"If Jane was to meet her and have words,
I don't know what I should do," he said. "It
would be best not to remind her of Pattie at all."</p>

<p>"Not me!" answered Jim emphatically.</p>
<br />
<br />
<hr style="width: 50%;" />
<br />
<h2><a name="x" id="x"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h2>A MEAN THING.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>There was no need to remind Jane of the
offending Pattie in words. Tom's face had
done that already, and she was meditating
vengeance. She and Jim and the baby reached
their own home at midnight on Easter Monday,
and by nine o'clock on the Tuesday morning
she was at the weekly washtub which she
superintended in Old Keston, her arms immersed
in soap suds, her eyes on the garden
fence which cut her off from Pattie's premises.</p>

<p>If she could only catch sight of Pattie hanging
out washing, and have a few words with her!</p>

<p>Pattie, however, was not at the wash-tub
this week. In Denys's and Gertrude's absence
all the washing had been sent out, to leave
Pattie more time to help Mrs. Brougham, and
at that minute Pattie was busily running
round the house tidying up after the holiday,
and looking forward to taking little Maud out
in the afternoon, a treat which she was beginning
to appreciate very highly.</p>

<p>As Tom had said, she looked tired, even
though it was so early in the day; but she
would not have allowed for an instant that
she had anything to trouble her. Why should
she have, when she had only to let Sam Willard,
the butcher's assistant, know when she would
be out for an hour in the evening, and there he
would be at the corner waiting for her, with his
fine air and his curled moustache and his hair
in a curl on his forehead. And he had no end
of money, he was always chinking a pocketful,
and talking of what he should buy. Only
on Saturday he had taken her round to look
at the shops, and they had lingered a long time
outside a jeweller's, and Sam had pointed out
the ring he meant to give his sweetheart some
day. Pattie had quite held her breath as she
imagined her hand with that ring on it!</p>

<p>Now as she swept up the bedrooms she glanced
at her hands and frowned. She was not very
clever at keeping her hands nice, but she always
excused herself with the plea that grates and
wash-tubs and saucepans were to blame.</p>

<p>The hands that wore that ring would not be
used for brooms and black-lead brushes! She
wondered what furniture would be bought to
match that ring!</p>

<p>And then, involuntarily, she thought of
another Saturday evening when Tom had taken
her to look at the shops, and they had lingered
outside, not a jeweller's, but a furniture shop,
and Tom had pointed out a tall Windsor arm-chair
and said they would have two of those
in their home, and she had pictured herself
in one of those chairs by a bright fireside in a
cosy kitchen with Tom opposite to her, reading
his paper, while she had a bit of dainty white
needlework in her lap, such as she had seen her
last mistress, who was newly married, busy
with. She remembered how, as she pictured
that happy little fireside, she had made up her
mind to keep her hands better, not for the
wearing of jewelled rings, but for the accomplishment
of that same dainty needlework.</p>

<p>As she thought of all this, Tom's face came
back to her memory. She wished, oh, how she
wished that she had looked round at him when
her friend had whispered that he was on the
other side of the road!</p>

<p>What had he looked like? Why should her
friend look upon his face and she not see it?</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! Tom!" she whispered to herself
and a sudden hate towards that jewelled
ring sprang up in her.</p>

<p>When the afternoon came and she wheeled
little Maud out in her mail cart, she turned
towards the shops. She felt as if to see that
Windsor arm-chair again would be next best to
seeing Tom.</p>

<p>But the Windsor arm-chair was gone. Gone,
like the dream of the happy little home; gone,
as Tom had gone, out of her life.</p>

<p>Its place was filled by an inexpensive plush-covered
parlour suite, suitable to the little
villa where the wearer of that jewelled ring
should take up her abode, but Pattie turned
from it petulantly.</p>

<p>"Cheap and nasty!" she said.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that on this afternoon,
when Jane Adams came to hang out the last
of her washing, she found herself short of pegs.
At another time she would have managed
with pins or hung the clothes in bunches, but
all day the craving for beer had been growing
upon her, and she determined to go out and
buy pegs and have a drink.</p>

<p>Through force of circumstances she had not
tasted a drop since Saturday at dinner-time.
Three whole days without a glass of beer!
There had been none at her father's home, of
course. The old people had been abstainers
since she and Tom were babies, and she had
not cared to acknowledge to them that she
"took a drop now and again." It had been
too late when she and Jim reached home last
night to fetch any, and she had hurried to her
work this morning, and, indeed, had not thought
of getting a glass on her way, so full was her
mind of Pattie.</p>

<p>But now she meant to have a glass, and pegs
she <em>must</em> have!</p>

<p>So having told her lady&#8212;about the pegs&#8212;she
put on her bonnet and hurried out.</p>

<p>She soon found a grocer's and bought her
pegs, and then she turned in to the nearest
public-house.</p>

<p>Not one glass, nor two, nor three, were
sufficient to allay her longing, and the housekeeping
money went without a thought; it
was only the remembrance of the fleeting time
which stayed her. She did not wish her lady
to wonder where she was.</p>

<p>When she pushed open the public-house
door and emerged into the street again, she was
not completely mistress of herself, but just in
the state when she would be very affable or
very quarrelsome, as circumstances should seem
to point.</p>

<p>And as she put her foot upon the threshold,
Pattie, wheeling little Maud, and with her
heart full of Tom, came along the pavement.</p>

<p>Now Pattie was a staunch little abstainer;
all the more staunch because of her childhood's
memories. Memories of nights when, piteous
and shivering, she had waited outside a public-house
door, to lead home her poor sorrowful
mother, bound indeed by Satan these many
years, by the chain of strong drink. Memories
of days when on bended knee she had pleaded
with that mother to give up the drink, and had
been answered by a shake of the head, and a
murmured, "I can't, child, I can't! I would
if I could."</p>

<p>And Pattie had known of no remedy, no saving
power, till she knew Tom, and Tom had said,
"Pray for her, my girl. Christ can save her!"</p>

<p>So Pattie had prayed, not understanding
how help could come, but because Tom believed
in it, and, strange answer as it seemed, an
illness had fallen upon her mother and she had
been taken away to the Workhouse Infirmary.</p>

<p>Pattie remembered to this day the very
saucepan she was washing when she realized
that <em>this</em> was the answer to her prayer, that
her poor mother had been saved from herself,
and taken to a place where she would be cared
for, and kept from the terrible snare of drink.</p>

<p>"And now," Tom had said when she told him,
"we must teach her about the love of Jesus."</p>

<p>So month after month since then, Tom had
gone regularly to the Infirmary and read the
gospel's message to Pattie's mother, for she
was still there and never likely to come out,
and the poor woman had come to look for him
and to love him as her own son. Pattie
wondered sometimes whether he still went, but
on the one occasion that she had seen her
mother since she gave Tom up, she had been
too proud to ask.</p>

<p>Pattie never saw a woman come out of a
public-house without an involuntary shiver at
her heart, and now here, before her very eyes,
came Tom's own sister, Jim Adams's wife!</p>

<p>Pattie recognised her in an instant, and she
recognised Pattie, and though Pattie would
only too willingly have passed on, Jane stood
in her path and barred the way.</p>

<p>"Well! Pattie Paul," said she insolently.
"I want to know what you mean by it."</p>

<p>"I don't know what <em>you</em> mean," said Pattie,
trying to pass her, but Jane dodged her.</p>

<p>"Oh don't you?" she cried. "What do
you mean by using my brother like you have,
letting him dangle after you, and pretending
you was going to marry him, and getting
presents out of him?"</p>

<p>Pattie's face flamed.</p>

<p>"It's not true!" she said hotly. "I never
got presents out of him, and I always meant
to marry him&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>Jane sneered.</p>

<p>"Very likely!" she said, "he did well
enough to play with, till a richer chap came
along, and then you remembered Tom was
poor! You're a mean thing, Pattie Paul!"</p>

<p>"Let me pass!" cried Pattie vehemently,
"you've no right to say such things!"</p>

<p>"No right!" flared Jane, "and me seeing
my own brother going thin and a-fretting for a
worthless girl like you! No right!"</p>

<p>But Pattie stayed to hear no more. With a
sudden turn of the mail-cart, she was past her
enemy, and running swiftly down the pavement
towards St. Olave's, while little Maud laughed
and clapped her hands with delight; she thought
the run was all to amuse her.</p>

<p>And Tom was going thin and fretting!</p>

<p>In the midst of her pride, anger and humiliation,
that thought came back to Pattie over
and over again.</p>

<p>But the anger and the pride predominated,
and swept away all tenderer feelings, and she
met Sam Willard in the evening with a laugh
and a toss of the head, and wished that Jane
were there to see.</p>

<h2><a name="xi" id="xi"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h2>WITH A PURPOSE.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>When Gertrude made up her mind to seek
out a marriage-portion for herself, whose chief
ingredient should be money, with love as a
secondary consideration, she set herself with
her usual cool forethought to consider the
matter of Reggie Alston.</p>

<p>Reggie was a friend, and a friend only he
must remain, and to this end the regular correspondence
which he and she had kept up since
Reggie left school, must become irregular and
fitful. If only he would take his summer
holiday in the school holidays, Gertrude thought
she could manage somehow to be away when
he was at home, and that would break the
continuity of other summer holidays when they
two had spent much time together, cycling
and playing tennis. It was a pity for the
boy to set his heart on what could not be.
Reggie ought to look out for a girl with money,
or at any rate for a girl who&#8212;who&#8212;liked
being poor.</p>

<p>The result of these cogitations was that
many a time when Reggie confidently looked
for a letter, none came, and when the dulness
of a week's work did happen to be enlivened
by one of Gertrude's epistles, somehow the
letters were short and unsatisfactory and spoke
only of the most casual on-the-top-of-things
topics. Reggie wondered over it in silence.
He hated writing scolding letters, and like
Tom Green, he felt that no amount of talking
or writing could bring love, and at first he only
felt the miss of the regular correspondence,
without seeking for a reason other than the
excuse that Gertrude must be extra busy at
school, or that she had fresh duties laid upon
her since Denys's engagement, of which he had
heard a full account before Gertrude had
thought of reducing her correspondence.</p>

<p>He little dreamed that Gertrude herself
missed the writing of those old confidential
letters far more than she had expected. She
had always saved up all the little experiences
and jokes of school and home to tell Reggie,
and now it was very dull to be always pulling
herself up to remember to make her letters
short and few and casual.</p>

<p>But when Easter Monday and his birthday
arrived together, without bringing any birthday
remembrance other than a letter from his old
chum, Charlie Henchman, Reggie's heart went
down to a depth for which he had no idea there
was room in his mechanism.</p>

<p>He had come down to breakfast in his dull
little parlour, confidently expecting to see
Gertrude's handwriting on his table, and it
was not there.</p>

<p>He sat down mechanically and looked round
the dull little room, and the dulness of it, the
dinginess, the unhomelikeness of it struck on
his heart as it had never done before.</p>

<p>The small horsehair sofa where he sometimes
tried to find a resting-place and failed; the
tiny chiffonnier, unenlightened by a looking-glass
or any ornament save a vase, which had
been one of Gertrude's childish birthday presents
to him, and which he always kept filled with
flowers and called them Gertrude's flowers; the
uncomfortable horsehair arm-chair and the bare
breakfast table with its coarse cloth and clumsy
china, had all been bearable while he looked
forward to a dainty and pretty, though tiny,
home with Gertrude.</p>

<p>The half loaf of bread and the pat of butter
which always tasted of the chiffonnier-cupboard,
but had to be kept there because when a piece
went out to the larder, none ever returned, filled
him with loathing this morning.</p>

<p>Why was there no letter from Gertrude?
His landlady bustled in with his tea and a
rasher of bacon and a slice of toast, the last
item, as she remarked, being for a birthday
treat, and he roused himself from his disappointment
to thank her for the little attention,
and when she was gone he slowly opened
Charlie's letter.</p>

<p>It was just a newsy, chatty letter, telling of
the pleasures of his holiday at Whitecliff and
especially of the pleasure of being with Denys for
a whole week, but when he came to one sentence,
written only with the thought of giving pleasure
to Reggie, Reggie stopped and frowned.</p>

<p>"Gertrude looks awfully well and seems
enjoying herself tremendously," wrote Charlie.
"She and Audrey are quite friends, which is
convenient, and Denys and I don't feel selfish
if we walk behind and let Gertrude, Audrey,
and Cecil make the pace in front."</p>

<p>So Gertrude was at Whitecliff, and she had
never thought it worth while to tell him she
was going to have such a nice change!</p>

<p>She was enjoying herself tremendously!
Hitherto she had always made him a sharer
in her pleasures by her vivacious descriptions
of them. Who was Cecil?</p>

<p>He looked across the narrow Scotch street,
on to the row of small houses opposite him.
The morning sunshine was flooding them,
while his room lay in shadow. That was
like his life. He was in the shadow and other
people were in the sunshine&#8212;especially this
Cecil.</p>

<p>He ate up his breakfast at last and made
a good meal of it too, for he was a healthy
fellow, and even stale bread and tasty butter
go down when you are hungry, and then he
got out his cycle and polished it up, for there
was a club run on and he was going to ride
part of the way out with them, returning early
to attend a wedding in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He decided, as he rubbed away at his machine,
that he would not be married on a Bank holiday,
when his turn came. He would not like his
guests to feel bored at losing one of their precious
few-and-far-between holidays. Saturday was
a much more sensible day for a wedding.</p>

<p>Bored or not bored, the wedding party was
large and cheerful, and being mostly made up
of the chief townsfolk and local gentry who
banked at the one and only Bank, Reggie
knew most of the guests, and was himself,
partly owing to his merry, boyish ways, and
partly owing to his modesty and readiness to
serve anybody in the smallest things, quite a
popular person. He enjoyed the first part of
the proceedings very much.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, with brilliant sunshine
and a warm air that seemed as if summer had
come to surprise the Spring, and directly the
bride had cut the cake there was a general
exodus to the garden, where camp chairs and
rout seats stood invitingly on the lawn, and
arbours and sheltered paths waited for visitors
to rest or walk beneath their budding loveliness.</p>

<p>And behind the groups of gay dresses, set
off by black coats and light trousers, came
white aproned waitresses with cakes and champagne.
In vain Reggie, who had missed getting
a cup of tea indoors, watched for a tray of
tea cups. Champagne and ices, cakes and
champagne, champagne and sandwiches. There
appeared to be nothing else, and everybody
seemed to be drinking champagne like so much
water. Everybody, that is, but Reggie and
the Scotch minister and his wife.</p>

<p>Except for the desire for a beverage that
was not champagne, Reggie did not think a
great deal about what he supposed was usual
at weddings, till he caught a whisper between
two girls whom he was piloting to see some
ducklings on the pond at the bottom of the
garden.</p>

<p>"Howard can't walk straight already,"
whispered one with a giggle.</p>

<p>"Isn't it horrid!" answered the other,
"Leslie Johns took me round the garden just
now, and he told me he had had far more champagne
than Howard had, but Howard has a
weak head. Howard wanted me to go to the
conservatories with him. I'm glad I didn't;
I should have been positively ashamed to be
seen with him. Why can't such fellows let
champagne alone?"</p>

<p>"They might at least know when to stop,"
sneered the first speaker.</p>

<p>Reggie, leading the way a few paces in front,
between close rows of gooseberry bushes, heard
every word, and he set his teeth.</p>

<p>The subtle distinction between the man
who had taken a quantity of champagne and
shewed no effects, and the man who had only
had a little and showed it, did not appeal to
him. He felt a vast pity for Howard, though
he had not the slightest idea who Howard
might be.</p>

<p>He got rid of his charges sooner than he
had hoped, for a hint that the bride would
soon be down from changing her dress, reached
the girls and made them hurry back to the
house, and Reggie, suddenly sick at heart with
combined remembrances that he and everybody
else must probably, in the general
gathering of guests to one place, see poor
Howard's faltering footsteps, and the thought
of Gertrude enjoying herself so much that she
could not write for his birthday, made his way
slowly and by a circuitous route back to the
main party.</p>

<p>He was nearing the house when a turn in
the path brought him face to face with a young
and handsomely-dressed woman, his own Bank
Manager's wife, Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p>"Oh, Reggie!" she said with a sort of gasp,
"oh, Reggie, whatever shall I do? Look!"</p>
<br />
<br />
<hr style="width: 50%;" />
<br />
<h2><a name="xii" id="xii"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h2>MASTER AND MAN.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Reggie looked in the direction indicated.
Down a vista of pink and white apple blossom
that seemed in its pure loveliness to emphasize
the miserableness and shame of sin, came two
men, stumbling and laughing and stumbling
again and holding each other up. One was
Mr. Gray, the Bank Manager, the other, as
Reggie guessed in a moment, was Howard
Bushman, of whom he had just heard.</p>

<p>One glance was enough for Reggie, and his
eyes came back to his companion. She was
white and shivering.</p>

<p>"Oh Reggie!" she said again, "help him,
do help him, it will ruin him."</p>

<p>Just behind her was a small summer-house.
It came to Reggie all in a moment what to do.</p>

<p>"Go and sit down in there," he said gently,
"and when Mr. Gray comes, keep him with
you till I get back."</p>

<p>Then he went swiftly to meet that stumbling,
laughing pair, and he spoke as gently as
he had done to the poor wife.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gray is sitting down in that summer-house,"
he said, "I think she wants you.
Will you stay with her while I run to the house
for something?"</p>

<p>The Bank Manager laughed foolishly.</p>

<p>"He! He! Reggie! Looking after the
ladies, as usual! Bring some champagne, my
lad, and we'll have a nice little spree on the
quiet."</p>

<p>But Reggie had not waited for directions.</p>

<p>He walked swiftly towards the house, but
he did not wish to appear hurried or to be on
any secret errand, and as he went his thoughts
flew hither and thither bewilderingly.</p>

<p>For this man was his master. This man
whom he had been asked to help, had much
of the making or marring of Reggie's prospects
in his hand, and to interfere, especially in such
a delicate matter, was almost certainly to
incur more anger, more abiding, unredeemable
displeasure, than for any other misdemeanour.</p>

<p>And yet, for four months Reggie had been
praying for this very man!</p>

<p>Three years before, when Charlie Henchman
had come to the engineering college in the
town, he had sought out the loneliest fellow
that he knew and for Christ's sake had
endeavoured to cheer and uplift and help him
by just being companionable to him. And
the loneliest fellow that Charlie knew was
Reggie Alston, and after they had been companions
for quite a long time they found out
that they both knew the Brougham family,
a link which drew them to be more than companions,&#8212;to
be friends.</p>

<p>Now Charlie was gone, and Reggie had
promised him to seek out some lonely fellow
too, and try to help him and cheer him and lead
him nearer to Christ. He had prayed to be
shown the right fellow, but among all his
acquaintances there was no one lonely; one
name, and one name only, seemed laid upon
his heart, the name of Mr. Gray, his own
Manager and master!</p>

<p>But as yet Reggie had done nothing more
than to pray for him earnestly and regularly,
for there seemed nothing else possible. For
how could a junior Bank clerk seek out the
companionship of his superior and invite him
to supper or to cycle or to go with him to
church?</p>

<p>He had been asked to help him now, and if
those ways in which he had wished to help
some fellow had seemed impossible, in this
case how much more impossible were these
circumstances? For to help in this way could
only bring the downfall of all Reggie's hopes of
promotion, and put off that day when he could
tell Gertrude that his home was ready for
her.</p>

<p>Yet with all these thoughts surging through
his brain, Reggie felt that the call of duty had
come to him, and to refuse would be to refuse to
take up his Cross and follow Christ. As he
took four cups of strong black coffee back to
the summer-house, he realised that the Cross is
the place of suffering and of death.</p>

<p>He had scarcely been five minutes on his
errand and the little party in the summer-house
had neither been added to nor diminished,
and hope had brought a little colour back to
Mrs. Gray's woe-begone face.</p>

<p>A simple straightforwardness was one of
Reggie's characteristics. He put a cup of
coffee into the manager's hand.</p>

<p>"You'd better drink it, Mr. Gray," he said
quietly, "it's&#8212;it's refreshing, and then if you'd
just take Mrs. Gray home&#8212;I'm sure she would
feel better at home, and the bride has gone,
so we can all slip away together. People are
beginning to go now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray hated black coffee, but she drank
her cup bravely, and looked all the better for
it too.</p>

<p>"That stuff is refreshing," said Howard,
suddenly, with a nod towards the empty
cups, as the four left the summer-house, to
make their farewells. "I felt rotten, but I
feel as right as a trivet now."</p>

<p>Mr. Gray said nothing. He knew perfectly
well that he was being helped, and his pride
fiercely resented it, but Reggie's three years of
quiet faithful work had had its influence, and
the clinging touch of Mrs. Gray's hand on his
arm softened him, and he said to himself that
Reggie had an unbounded cheek, but there was
really nothing to wait for any longer, now that
the bride had gone.</p>

<p>But there's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip.
The bride's mother, shaking hands and saying
pleasant nothings to the first of her departing
guests, looked at Mr. Gray reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray! you are never going to desert
us already! We want our brightest stars to
help illumine our darkness. Mrs. Gray feeling
ill? Surely, my dear Elaine, you do not need
<em>three</em> gentlemen to take you home!"</p>

<p>The colour flamed into Mrs. Gray's cheeks.</p>

<p>"My husband is taking me home," she said
proudly, "Mr. Alston and Mr. Bushman happen
to be leaving at the same time."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> rather early," admitted Mr. Gray.
He had caught sight of a fresh tray of glasses
going the round of a circle of his acquaintances,
and he decided not to be managed any longer,
but to do as he chose.</p>

<p>"Look here, Elaine!" he said in a low tone,
"you let Reggie take you home. I won't be
a few minutes, but I must speak to Thornton.
I've been looking for him all the afternoon,
and it's really important."</p>

<p>"I'm sure <em>you</em> are not in a hurry, Howard,"
said the hostess.</p>

<p>So Reggie and Mrs. Gray found themselves
outside the gate alone.</p>

<p>"I'll never go inside that gate again," cried
Mrs. Gray, angrily. Then she added piteously,
"Oh, Reggie, I thought we had got him safe."</p>

<p>"So did I," said Reggie, ruefully.</p>

<p>"What <em>can</em> I do?" she moaned, "I've seen
it coming on little by little, and now he's
beginning not to care so much if&#8212;if people
guess. I'm glad you know, Reggie; it's a
comfort to have somebody to speak to. I
used to think I should be perfectly happy if I
had plenty of money&#8212;we girls at home used
to be poor till Aunt died and left us her property,
just before I was engaged, and now, often, I
think I would so willingly have just John's
income&#8212;and it's only a small income for so
responsible a position&#8212;or work hard myself,
if I could be sure of&#8212;of him. But there it
is," she added sadly. "Tell me what I can do,
Reggie."</p>

<p>"You can pray for him," said Reggie,
earnestly, "God <em>does</em> hear and answer prayer
and He can save to the uttermost." He
hesitated and then added in a lower tone,</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gray, are you an abstainer yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well, not quite," said she, "but I hardly
take anything."</p>

<p>Reggie nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you take as much as you care to,
and he takes as much as <em>he</em> cares to. That
is how Mr. Gray would look at it, and the way
God looks at it is this, '<em>Judge this rather that
no man put a stumbling block or an occasion
to fall in his brother's way. Anything whereby
thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made
weak.</em>'"</p>

<p>They had reached the Bank and she held
out her hand with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, "well, I'll think
about it."</p>

<p>Reggie walked on to the corner of his own
road and stood looking down it distastefully.</p>

<p>Here he was in the middle of Bank holiday
afternoon, in his best clothes, with nowhere to
go and no one to speak to, feeling as if his life
and himself and everything else were an utter
failure. If he had only had on his cycling suit,
he might have contemplated a ride, but the
thought of turning into his dull lodgings, even
to change, was unbearable, and the writing
of a letter to Gertrude, with which he had
beguiled many a lonely hour before, was not
possible to-day.</p>

<p>He turned at the sound of quick footsteps
behind him, and heard his name called.</p>

<p>"Why! Mr. Alston!" said the cheerful voice
of the Scotch minister's little wife, "you look
as if you belonged to nobody, and nowhere!"</p>

<p>Then, seeing instantly that her words had
hit too near the mark, she added quickly,</p>

<p><a name="supper" id="supper"></a>"I wish, if you aren't engaged, you would
come home to supper with us. I always feel
as if I wanted to be entertained after a wedding,
as if it were very dull to go home to just an
ordinary tea, and its being a Bank holiday
seems to emphasise the feeling. Mr. Mackenzie
and I were just saying so, weren't we, Will?"</p>

<p>"That is so," assented Mr. Mackenzie, with
his grave smile, "I hear, Mr. Alston, that you
are musical and might have played our organ
for the marriage had we but known it. I have
the organ keys, if you would care to try the
instrument. It was unfortunate that our
organist was away. I like a little singing at a
wedding."</p>

<p>Reggie's face beamed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to come, awfully," he said, "what
time shall I turn up?"</p>

<p>"Why, now!" said Mrs. Mackenzie, "we'll
have tea at once and then the garden-boy shall
blow for you, and we'll be audience, and then
we can have supper and talk."</p>

<p>"That's the chief item in the programme,
isn't it?" said her husband, with a twinkle.</p>

<p>Reggie tried to smother a laugh but did not
succeed. This unexpected treat had wonderfully
cheered his drooping spirits, and he laughed
and chatted merrily as they walked to the
Manse; but beneath the outward pleasure that
the invitation gave him, there was running an
undercurrent of deep happiness, for he knew
that in the moment of the most intense loneliness,
the most utter hopelessness that he had
ever known, God had sent His angel and
delivered him.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Mackenzie talked on in her usual
cheerful, lighthearted way and never dreamed
that she had been God's angel to any one that
afternoon. Reggie was too shy to tell her,
and she had not the key to the thoughts of the
young organist who first woke the echoes of
the church for her, with the strains of,</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="But the Lord">

<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">He remembers His children.</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>That was for to-day and for to-morrow too,
in Reggie's mind. As the evening wore on,
the dread of the to-morrow morning, when at
nine o'clock he must meet Mr. Gray, grew upon
him. That his interference had been resented,
even while it was accepted, Reggie had seen
quite plainly, and to-morrow was coming nearer
with each tick of the clock.</p>
<br />
<br />
<hr style="width: 50%;" />
<br />
<h2><a name="xiii" id="xiii"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h2>BEARDING THE LION.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>When Reggie entered the Bank just before
nine o'clock on the following morning, his
heart was going pit-a-pat, for he knew his chief
well enough to be certain that it was impossible
to count upon how he would look at yesterday's
happenings. He might never think of the
occurrence again, or he might refer to it with
an easy laugh at Reggie's stricter principles,
or he might be riding the high horse and resent
the interference to an extent which Reggie
knew would be long enduring, if it ever ceased
at all.</p>

<div class="noindent" style="text-align: center" >
<img src="images/illus121.jpg" alt="I Wish." title="I Wish." /><br />
"'I wish, if you aren't engaged, you would come home to supper
with us.'"&#8212;<em><a href="#supper">Page&#160;118</a>.</em></div>

<p>So much depended on how Mrs. Gray had
dealt with the matter, and on how long her
husband had remained with his convivial
friends, and on these two points Reggie had no
knowledge. Yet much of the success which attended
his efforts for Mr. Gray this morning,
had their beginning in the fact that Mrs. Gray
had received her husband late the night before,
with no word of reproach, but had treated
him with unusual gentleness and affection, and
he had come down to his work this morning
softened by love, and not hardened by bitter
words or arguments. Reggie chided himself for
thinking so much of the harm he might have
done his own future, but with another morning's
post in, and no birthday letter from Gertrude,
he felt more sore and more uneasy. If his
prospects at the Bank became gloomy, what
would be his chances of securing Gertrude?</p>

<p>But when he went into Mr. Gray's private
room, nothing was written so plainly on the
Manager's face as headache and dejection;
and a great wave of pity and desire, swept
away from Reggie all thought of himself and
of his own happiness.</p>

<p>What could he do to help this man who
was slipping down into the bondage of strong
drink?</p>

<p>What <em>had</em> Mrs. Gray said and done, he
wondered, as he listened to the dull, listless
voice in which Mr. Gray bade him take the
omnibus at once, and proceed to the house of
a wealthy client who lived three miles out of
the town, and who had been taken ill and
wished to transact some business.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity now to think
of anything but the matters to be arranged
with the wealthy client, which were important
and urgent, and the minutes before the omnibus
started were few, so the moment Reggie was
sure he understood his errand he took his hat,
relocked his desk and stepped out from the
Bank, well pleased to be leaving the town for a
country outing, on such a lovely April morning.</p>

<p>But as he glanced down the long, sunny
street, he saw something which suddenly
arrested his footsteps.</p>

<p>Only a gentleman crossing the road and
coming towards him, but a gentleman whose
identity was unmistakable even at this distance,
by reason of a very peculiar lameness. A
gentleman who was one of the largest shareholders,
and had much influence in the Bank&#8212;a
man who was so stern a teetotaller that he
could forgive any sin sooner than intemperance.</p>

<p>In one instant Reggie was back in the Bank,
Mr. Gray's hat was in his hand, and he was
standing beside the astonished Manager.
"Quick!" he said breathlessly. "You go down
to Muirend House instead of me&#8212;here's your
hat! Don't ask any questions, and when you
get outside, turn to the left and don't look
behind you on any account. Never mind the
omnibus; it will do you good to walk! Quick&#8212;or
you'll be too late."</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Mr. Gray, "are you
going wrong in the head, Reggie?"</p>

<p>Reggie repeated his request, still breathlessly,
and there was something so insistent
in his manner, so beseeching in his eyes, and
his three years of patient faithful work, so
rose up to help his influence, that the Manager
actually stood up, laid down his pen and took
his hat.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what you are playing
at," said he, a little coldly. "What is it I am
to do? Turn to the left and not look behind
me!"</p>

<p>"Yes! that's it," said Reggie eagerly;
"oh, be quick, or it will be too late."</p>

<p>"And I'm to walk, though it's three miles,"
said the Manager. "Well! take care of the
Bank; it appears to me that it has a new
Manager!"</p>

<p>He passed out through the swing doors, and
a couple of minutes went by and he did not
return, and Reggie began to breathe freely,
till the fear struck him that after all, his efforts
had been of no use if Mr. Bowles, the lame
gentleman, had just caught Mr. Gray on the
pavement outside, but even as the thought
darted into his mind, the doors swung open
again, and the lame gentleman entered and
looked round. "Mr. Gray?" said he, interrogatively,
as Reggie came forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray has just gone down to Muirend
to see Mr. Collins, who is very ill."</p>

<p>"It is very inconvenient of him," said
Mr. Bowles irritably, "I wrote so that he should
get the letter by the first post this morning."</p>

<p>Reggie glanced down at the pile of letters
he had just brought from Mr. Gray's room to
open.</p>

<p>"It will be here, I expect," he said politely,
"can I take your instructions?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bowles grunted and scowled, but nevertheless
he followed Reggie into the Manager's
room and ran through what he had come to
say, and watched Reggie's careful noting down
of the points.</p>

<p>"So Lily Jarrold got married yesterday,"
he said abruptly, as Reggie finished. "I
suppose champagne ran like rivers, and half
you fellows got drunk, and the girls did not
know what they were laughing at, eh? Were
<em>you</em> there?"</p>

<p>"I was there," answered Reggie, a trifle
stiffly, "it was a very pretty wedding, and she
looked awfully happy."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the old gentleman, "but
wasn't it as I said, afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I did not stay late&#8212;and I am an abstainer,"
said Reggie, wishing his visitor would depart.
He glanced at the pile of unopened letters he
had brought back with him, and Mr. Bowles
intercepted the glance.</p>

<p>"Well! well!" said he, "that's a good
hearing, my boy, and I see you are wishing I'd
be off and let you get at your work. Industry is
of the utmost importance, my lad, and you'll
rise to be Manager, one day! Tell Mr. Gray I
need not see him till next week as he left such
a capable second. Good morning."</p>

<p>That was over. Reggie saw him out, opened
the letters, and went through the usual routine
of his morning work, and welcomed back his
fellow clerk who had been away for the Easter.
The clock ticked peacefully on, till it was
past noon, and then at last the swing doors
opened once more to admit the Manager.</p>

<p>He passed straight through to his room,
closing the door behind him. A moment later
he opened it again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alston!" he said.</p>

<p>"Now for it," thought Reggie.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray was seated at his table and he
motioned Reggie to the seat usually assigned
to clients, and there was a pause. Reggie
felt all his courage oozing out at the toes of
his boots. All that he had thought it possible
he <em>might</em> say to Mr. Gray on this question, all
his arguments, all his reasons, his pleas, seemed
to melt away into thin air, and he wondered
however he had dared to interfere in another
man's life, and that man his master, even to the
degree of wishing to help him and praying for
him, much more in openly offering him coffee,
and sending him out of the sight of condemning
eyes!</p>

<p>But with the remembrance of that four
months of daily prayer for this man, came
the remembrance of words spoken long ago to
faint-hearted men. "The battle is not yours,
but God's." That made all the difference.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Gray spoke, coldly, hardly.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Alston, what is the meaning
of all this?"</p>

<p>Reggie leant forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray, don't be angry, it was just Mr.
Bowles coming along. I saw him as I got
outside and&#8212;and&#8212;you know what he is, and&#8212;I
thought&#8212;you could do the Muirend business&#8212;and&#8212;oh,
I <em>wish</em> you would give up this
strong drink, it is going to ruin you, body
and soul!"</p>

<p>It was out. The bitter truth had been put
into words; the young clerk had told his
Manager that he knew his sin and degradation.
The words had been spoken, and never again
could things be as they had been before they
were spoken, and Reggie knew it, and he knew
that the man who sat before him with his face
shaded with his hand, was a proud, proud
man.</p>

<p>The clock ticked on loudly and evenly.
There seemed nothing more for Reggie to say,
and Mr. Gray did not break the silence. He
was filling in the details of Reggie's broken
words and he knew Mr. Bowles well enough
to do it very accurately. He had reason to
believe that Mr. Bowles had made a special
visit on this special morning with intent. He
knew, ah, far more truly than Reggie did, that
this temptation was ruining his worldly position.
Reggie had saved his reputation for this time
and he could not but thank him, and yet&#8212;and
yet&#8212;how hard it was to humble himself to say
so; and there stretched before his weary eyes
those times, coming oftener and oftener, when
his reputation would not be saved, and he
would sink lower in men's estimation, and that
would come to be openly said, which was
already a whisper, that the Bank Manager
<em>drank</em>.</p>

<p>His thoughts came back to Reggie with a
start. Reggie had asked him to give up strong
drink!</p>

<p>"Reggie!" he said hoarsely, passing by all
else that had been said, "you don't know
what you are asking!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" said Reggie firmly, "and
you'll want outside help."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the manager sadly, "I have
thought sometimes, that if we'd had a child,
Elaine and I, it would have made it easier. I
might have done it for the child's sake."</p>

<p>"Suppose that God did not dare to risk
the child in your hands," said Reggie solemnly,
"suppose, if He sent a child, then you had not
the strength to give up the drink?"</p>

<p>And as the words fell from Reggie's lips
there came a sound from the outer office that
made both the men start.</p>

<p>"Father!" said a little treble voice which
rang through the Bank. "Father! father!
let me do it."</p>

<p>The manager raised himself so that he could
see over the frosted glass in the door which
gave on to the front premises, but Reggie had
no need to look. He recognised the clear
child's voice. He seemed to see little Cyril
Mackenzie's round, rosy face lifted confidingly
to his father's as he had seen it only last
night. And Mr. Gray saw the bright little lad,
and he sat down again in his seat with a
groan, and hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Suppose&#8212;" he said, "suppose I haven't
the strength to give it up <em>now</em>."</p>

<p>"It was the help of Jesus Christ, our Saviour,
that I meant. He will give you the strength
if you will let Him, and I will help you all I
can, if you will let me," answered Reggie
earnestly.</p>

<h2>AN UNWELCOME GUEST.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Denys had undertaken, at the earnest request
of the woman at the Landslip Cottage, to take
care of Harry as far as to Mixham Junction,
where his uncle would meet him.</p>

<p>She was on her way to the Landslip cottage
to make sure that the arrangements for meeting
Harry at the station the following day were
all complete, a duty which had obliged her to
give up a two hours' drive with Mrs. Henchman,
Audrey and Gertrude, who had all gone with a
friend of Mrs. Henchman's.</p>

<p>Denys had, however, scarcely entered the
Landslip road when she encountered little
Harry and his kind friend, and being thus
saved more than an hour's walk, she arrived
back at Mrs. Henchman's house much sooner
than she had expected.</p>

<p>Mary opened the door for her, and Denys
was struck by her woebegone, weary face. For
a moment Denys hesitated, thinking of that
accusation of interference, thinking of Mary's
constant ungraciousness to her, but she pushed
the remembrance aside and said kindly, "Is
anything the matter, Mary? You look so sad."</p>

<p>Tears sprang into Mary's eyes at the unexpected
interest.</p>

<p>"It's my head, Miss," she said, "one of my
bad headaches, and its so unfortunate to-day,
because my brother is just coming home for
this one evening, and Mrs. Henchman was going
to let me go special, and by after tea I sha'n't
be able to hold my head up, and I've not seen
him for two years, and he's my favourite."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can see him to-morrow,"
suggested Denys.</p>

<p>"No, Miss; he's a gentleman's servant,
he is, and he's always travelling about. It
was just this one chance, and now I've missed
it."</p>

<p>"I've some headache pills&#8212;they are wonderful
for nervous headaches. You would not like
to try them, would you?" asked Denys.
"Mother has these dreadful nervous headaches
and nothing else has ever been any good to her."</p>

<p>"I'd try them, Miss, and be thankful."</p>

<p>Denys ran upstairs and came back to the
kitchen, "Could you not just lie down for
half-an-hour's sleep?" she said, "you might
wake up with it all gone."</p>

<p>Mary shook her head dolefully.</p>

<p>"It's the milkman, Miss, and I wouldn't
hear the door bell in my room."</p>

<p>Denys laughed.</p>

<p>"I have attended on the milkman before
now, and I can open the front door if necessary,"
said she cheerfully. "Now run away upstairs,
and I'll call you in plenty of time to get the tea
ready. I don't suppose I had better undertake
that!"</p>

<p>"You are real good, Miss," said Mary gratefully,
"if I do see my brother to-night, I shall
tell him it was all your doing."</p>

<p>Denys smiled to herself happily as she went
back to the dining-room, and sat down to
write to Charlie and to listen for the door bell.
She had hated to go away with the remembrance
of Mary's unpleasant looks, and the little bit of
sympathy she had offered had turned Mary
into a friend.</p>

<p>When Denys and Gertrude arrived at the
station the next day, little Harry was already
there, smiling and radiant. He greeted Denys
as a very old friend, and did not appear to be
the least homesick. The journey was of the
most intense interest to him, till at last the
rush and roar of the train made him drowsy,
and he climbed contentedly into Denys's arms
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Denys sat watching him for a long time,
wondering what his new life was to be, and she
was somewhat surprised to find Gertrude's
eyes also fixed upon the little face.</p>

<p>"I hope the people that child is going to
will be good to him," she said. "What do
you know about them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" said Denys. "His mother said
her brother had promised to take him, but she
had never seen the wife. Perhaps we shall see
her at Mixham, but anyhow, we can't do
anything except look him up now and then."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Gertrude, "I should pity
anybody who was in charge of the woman who
washes at the house at the bottom of our garden.
<em>She</em> comes from Mixham; Pattie used to be
engaged to her brother. She looks a perfect
vixen."</p>

<p>"Used to be engaged?" repeated Denys,
startled. "You don't mean to say it is broken
off? Poor Pattie!"</p>

<p>"Not poor Pattie at all," answered Gertrude
sharply. "<em>He</em> was as poor as anything, and
his isn't the sort of trade where they ever get
much money. Why, here's Mixham! Where's
that child's hat? Wake up, Tommy, or Harry,
or whatever your name is!"</p>

<p>Jim Adams, as he had promised, had come
down to meet Harry, and if he had been asked
what sort of a child he was going to look for,
he would have pointed to one of a dozen little
urchins, playing up and down his own street,
and said that boys were all alike.</p>

<p>So, as he was looking for a nondescript boy
in knickers and jacket and cap and heavy
boots, it was little wonder that he looked in
vain among the crowd of travellers who poured
out of the big train on the Junction platform,
and he was proportionately surprised when a
young lady with red-brown hair and a sweet
face touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to be Mr. Jim Adams?"
she asked in her soft, pretty voice.</p>

<p>Jim gasped as he looked down at her, and
saw the child she was holding by the hand. A
child in petticoats, almost a baby it seemed
to him, with a little <a name="frock" id="frock"></a>black kilted frock and
sailor coat, and a big white hat with a black
ribbon, and underneath it, golden curls and
the sweetest little face he had ever seen since
last he saw his sister Nellie's face!</p>

<p>He knew it in a moment, and his heart went
out to the child with an intensity of love that
astonished even himself, and an awful sort of
choke came into his throat as he stooped and
lifted Nellie's child in his arms.</p>

<p>"Hullo! little chap! I'm Uncle Jim," he
said.</p>

<p>Harry looked at him approvingly.</p>

<p>"I'm going to live along with you!" he
said. "Mother's gone away," he added mournfully.</p>

<p>The clasp of Jim's arms tightened on the
little fellow.</p>

<p>"I'm going to look after you now," he
whispered. Then he remembered Denys's
presence and he turned to her.</p>

<p>"Thank you for bringing him up, Miss.
They say as you was very kind to my poor
sister, and I thank you for that too. I'll do
my best by the little chap."</p>

<p>"There was one thing," said Denys, hesitatingly.
It did not seem so easy to say as she
had thought. The handsome, tall young workman
before her took away her breath somewhat,
and she wished she had written what Nellie
Lyon had particularly asked her to impress
upon Jim.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," said Jim wonderingly.</p>

<p>"She wanted him to be brought up an
abstainer," explained Denys, "as she and you
were brought up."</p>

<p>Jim's eyes dropped.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said after a moment, "Yes, he
shall, and so shall my own baby! I'll give 'em
all the chance I can to start right. I've been
trying to do without anything myself for this
two months," he added, with a shy little
laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that&#8212;we were all brought up
so," said Denys, heartily, "now Mr. Adams, I
may come and see Harry if I am in Mixham
any time, mayn't I? He's such a dear, lovable
little chap."</p>

<p>"That you may, Miss! any time," cried
Jim earnestly, "and I thank you once again,
and I'll do my best&#8212;every way."</p>

<p>He strode off with Harry still in his arms,
well pleased with his new possession, and turned
his steps towards home. But as he drew
nearer to his own door, his speed slackened.
What sort of a welcome would Jane give him&#8212;and
the child?</p>

<p>He had the sense to put him down and
let him walk into his new home, and so, hand
in hand, the big uncle and the little nephew
presented themselves before Jane.</p>

<p>She looked at the pair for a moment in
silence, and then burst into a loud, ironical
laugh.</p>

<p>"I always knew you were a cheat, Jim
Adams! You talked enough about your sister's
<em>boy</em> and you've brought a baby in petticoats."</p>

<p>"I'm not a baby&#8212;I'm going in four," said
Harry gravely, "that's a baby in there,"
pointing to the cradle. He crossed the room
and looked curiously down at the baby, and
the baby, pleased with the kind little face,
laughed and threw out its arms.</p>

<p>"Can't I have him out to play with? He
likes me," cried Harry, "look, Uncle Jim,
he's pulling my finger."</p>

<p>Jim lifted out his baby and sat down, and
Harry stood beside him, lost in admiration.</p>

<p>"Well, this <em>is</em> a nice set-out," said Jane
crossly, as she looked at the happy little trio,
"the first thing you do, Jim Adams, is to get
that boy some breeches. <em>I'm</em> not going to
wash a lot of petticoats." She stooped and
lifted Harry's frock&#8212;the little black frock
that Nellie had prepared weeks ago, ready for
this very time, knowing that there would be
no one to buy mourning for her child.</p>

<p>Jane examined the petticoats, and her face
relaxed a little.</p>

<p>"Humph!" she said, "they're not such
bad petticoats! They'll do for baby finely.
You can sell the frock, if you like, Jim Adams,
<em>that's</em> no good to me, and it will help towards
the breeches."</p>

<p>"Indeed I won't," answered Jim fiercely,
"if I part with the frock, I'll <em>give</em> it away.
Who made your pretty frock, Harry, boy?"</p>

<p>Harry looked down at himself proudly.</p>

<p>"My mother made that," he said, "that's
my bestest frock. She made it ages ago, but
she wouldn't never let me wear it."</p>

<p>Jim's eyes filled and he turned hastily to
the window that Jane might not perceive it.</p>

<p>"Don't you part with that frock, Jane,"
he said.</p>

<p>Jane snorted.</p>

<p>"Tea's ready!" she said ungraciously.</p>

<p>The meal was about half through when she
started a new subject.</p>

<p>"Where's the brat's bed?" said she.</p>

<p>"His bed?" repeated Jim, helplessly.</p>

<p>"His bed," she reiterated, "I suppose you
thought he'd share the baby's cradle!"</p>

<p>Jim kept what he had thought to himself.</p>

<p>"You must go and get one somewhere,"
decreed his wife.</p>

<p>Jim rose obediently and went downstairs.
In about half an hour he returned with his
arms full of irons, blankets and bedding.</p>

<p>"Here, Harry, boy," he said, "uncle's got
a jolly little bed for you!"</p>

<p>"Where did you get that?" demanded Jane.</p>

<h2><a name="xv" id="xv"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h2>THE LAST HOPE.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Little Harry Lyon found the circumstances
of his fresh life so entirely different from his
old existence, that he seemed a greater stranger
to himself than the most strange of those who
peopled his new world.</p>

<p>To begin with, he was, to use his aunt's own
term, "breeched" the next day, and his petticoats
became the big baby's property, while
his precious best frock was poked unceremoniously
into a box under his aunt's bed.</p>

<p>He looked after it with longing eyes. He
had waited so long to wear it and it seemed
too bad to have it taken away when he had
only worn it so few times, and it was made
with a pocket, the first he had ever had. As
he saw the box slammed down, he remembered
with a pang that in the pocket was his little
bestest white handkerchief with lace on it and in
the corner of the handkerchief, tied in an easy
knot, was a penny that Denys had given him.</p>

<p>He had never dared to ask her again for even
a ha'penny, but one day she had given him a
bright penny that shone like gold and he had
treasured it with utmost joy, more because he
had not asked for it, than for its value as a
penny.</p>

<p>The edge of the box which held his treasures
stuck out from under the bed, and he watched
it for a long time, resolving in his little mind
that one day he would manage somehow to
get his own again.</p>

<p>The confinement of his new life irked
him as much as his breeches, for he had
been used to wandering about the Landslip
and the Whitecliff beach at his own pleasure,
and now there were but two rooms to wander
in, or at best a short and narrow street, beyond
whose limits he was forbidden to go, and it
was filled with rough and noisy children who
pushed him and pinched him and who roared
vociferously whenever they saw him, after they
discovered that his name was Lyon.</p>

<p>He had always made friends with all the
sailors and visitors at Whitecliff, but here the
men and women hurried about their business
and never even glanced at the golden-headed
little chap, and there were no boats to be pulled
up and pushed out, and no tide, and no sands,
and no&#8212;no <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>Harry stood at the top of the dull street
looking forlornly about him, when he came to
that conclusion, and when he realised it, he
burst into a sudden fit of heart-broken crying.</p>

<p>There were no loving arms now in which
to sob out his woes, and he turned his little
back upon the world and covering his face
with his hands, leaned his head against a big
brick wall and wept, and wept, and wept for
his mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, mummy&#8212;mummy&#8212;mummy&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Why, Harry!" said his Uncle Jim's voice,
"whatever's the matter with you? You
shouldn't be crying&#8212;you're a big boy now.
Have the boys been hitting you?"</p>

<p>Harry did not turn or heed him.</p>

<p>"Oh, mummy&#8212;mummy&#8212;mummy," he
wailed.</p>

<p>"Harry!" said Jim again, "here's a penny
for you&#8212;let's go and buy some sweeties."</p>

<p>But Harry was past that.</p>

<p>"Oh, mummy&#8212;mummy&#8212;my mummy&#8212;I
want my mummy."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the heart-broken cry
this time, and Jim looked helplessly at Tom
Green who stood beside him.</p>

<p>"It's the old story," said Tom gently,
"'They have taken away my Lord and I
know not where they have laid him.'" Then
he stooped down to the level of the little weeping
child and drew him into his arms and
turned the tear-stained little face to rest on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Harry!" he said gently, "dear mummy
has gone to live in a beautiful Home with
Jesus and she's so happy and she doesn't cough
any more or feel tired any more. Oh, she's so
happy. And she is with Jesus. She used to
tell you about Him, didn't she?"</p>

<p>The comfort of the kind arms and the kind
voice, and above all, the words of hope that
carried the childish thoughts straight to happiness
and seemed to find his mother for him
again, comforted the little heart at once, and
Harry's sobs came only with a long drawn
breath as he listened.</p>

<p>Tom did not wait for an answer, he went on
in the same low, soothing tone.</p>

<p>"Jesus has got such a lovely Home ready
for dear mummy and He is getting one ready
for little Harry too, and one day Jesus will
call Harry and he will see Jesus and dear
mummy and the beautiful Home and be so
happy."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Harry nestling closer.
He was so tired of crying and being lonely,
and these arms held him so nicely. He gave
a deep, deep sigh which somehow spoke of
restfulness and of the sorrow being past, and
Tom raised himself and looked in the tear-stained
face a moment, then kissed it and
wiped it with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"That's better!" he said cheerfully, "would
you like a ride on Uncle Tom's shoulder?
Uncle Tom is coming home to tea with Harry,
and Uncle Tom's awful hungry&#8212;he's going to
eat a whole big loaf for tea."</p>

<p>Harry laughed gleefully as he found himself
swung in an instant on to Uncle Tom's shoulder
and was carried along high above all the other
little rough children's heads, and was even on
a level with Uncle Jim! By stretching out his
hand he could pat the top of Uncle Jim's head;
and he laughed again as he gave Uncle Jim a
good hard pat.</p>

<p>"You are a clever one, Tom," said Jim
admiringly, "how did you pick it up?"</p>

<p>Tom might have said, "Out of my own
sorrow," but he only smiled, and told Harry
to mind his head as he stopped at Jim's doorway
and carried him upstairs to Aunt Jane
and the baby.</p>

<p>Harry became Tom's devoted slave thenceforth,
and Jim watched the two playing and
whispering together almost jealously, and yet
he liked Tom too well to really grudge him the
child's love, and Tom looked so happy,&#8212;happier
than Jim had seen him since Pattie gave
him up.</p>

<p>Jim took notice too of the way Tom amused
the child, how he became a child for the time
being, and all the materials he had were trifles
from his pockets; a piece of paper and a
pencil, a few odd buttons and keys, a bit of
string and an empty match box!</p>

<p>Jim knew that <em>his</em> ingenuity could never
amuse Harry with such things, but he determined
to buy some toys that very evening, and
to try his hand at winning the child's heart
the next evening. Jane took very little notice
of any of them and after putting the baby to
bed, announced that she had shopping to do,
and as Tom saw her slip an empty jug into
her shopping basket, he knew what her final
destination would be and that she would not
return for some considerable time.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to put the little 'un to
bed before you go out, Jane?" he said, "we've
had a good spell of play and he's half asleep
now."</p>

<p>But Jane deigned no answer, unless the
slam of the door as she disappeared on to the
stairs, was one.</p>

<p>Jim shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Harry and me, we do the bedding-down
between us," he said rather sheepishly, "run
and get your nightie, boy."</p>

<p>Then as Harry trotted off, he added in a
lower tone, "She won't do nothing for him,
so I have to. It's no use arguing over everything
and so&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>Tom nodded. "So you have to be father
and mother both," he said. "He's more of
a little 'un than I expected, but he's a dear little
'un. I've right down enjoyed myself this
evening."</p>

<p>The two men between them undressed Harry
and superintended his prayers, and tucked
him into his bed, and then they sat by the
open window and chatted in low tones till the
sound of their voices had lulled Harry to sleep,
and then at last Tom rose and said he must be
going. He went over to the cot and stood
looking down on the little sleeping face, with
its regular features, its long lashes lying on the
bright cheeks, and its crown of tumbled golden
hair.</p>

<p>"He's like the pictures of the angels," he
said regretfully, "if Pattie and I had had our
little home, we'd have loved to let him stay
with us a bit, but I'll come in on Saturday and
take him on the river, if you'll let me. It seems
so long since I had anybody to go out with."</p>

<p>"Poor old Tom," said Jim affectionately,
"it's cut you very hard, but I always believe
it will come all right, you know!"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said an unexpected voice behind
them, "you would always believe anything
silly, Jim Adams! Come right, indeed! Very
likely! You just wait till I have seen Miss
Pattie Paul again."</p>

<p>"Have you seen her?" asked Tom in a
curiously quiet tone. He had gone very pale,
but his face was in shadow and Jane did
not perceive it or anything peculiar in his
voice.</p>

<p>"Ha!" she cried vaingloriously, "I have!
I let her know what I thought of her&#8212;mean
little cat."</p>

<p>"Jane!" said her husband warningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't stand up for her," she said
airily. "I'm not going to stand by and see
my brother treated so. But what's a talking-to
with a brazen hussy like that? Wait a bit,
I haven't thought how to do it yet, but I'm
going to pay her out. Trust me!"</p>

<p>And then Jim did what he had never done
in his life before,&#8212;he took his wife by the
shoulders and forcibly marched her into the
bedroom and shut the door upon her.</p>

<p>"Come, Tom!" he said touching him gently
on the shoulder, "we've had enough of this."</p>

<p>They passed down the stairs together, but
on the landing below Tom stopped, and
covering his face with his hands, leaned
against the wall.</p>

<p>"Oh Pattie, Pattie," he moaned, "that's
my last chance gone. And my own sister too."</p>

<p>Jim said nothing. He was not good at words,
but he waited till Tom had recovered himself,
and then he went right to his home with him
and made a cup of tea for him and sat and
chatted till past midnight.</p>

<p>"Don't be downhearted, old fellow," he
said when he parted from him.</p>

<p>But as he went home again he muttered to
himself and frowned.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Jane means to do? I
wonder what she <em>could</em> do?"</p>

<h2><a name="xvi" id="xvi"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h2>LINKS IN A CHAIN.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Gertrude had never had such a summer of
gaieties.</p>

<p>She had not long returned from Whitecliff
when a young American, cousin to Pauline
Stacey, with a long purse and unlimited ideas
of enjoying himself, made his appearance in
Old Keston.</p>

<p>He had "done" England, and wished to
stay with his Aunt Stacey "for a few days"
before going on to Switzerland, and with his
cousin Pauline's very ready help, he inaugurated
a series of boating excursions, moonlight strolls,
tennis matches and picnics, which lengthened
his visit into weeks instead of days, and in
which Gertrude, to her great delight, found
herself involved from the very first. Pauline
Stacey had long ago found Gertrude a far
more congenial spirit than her first friend,
Denys, had ever been, so that though Denys
was occasionally invited to the American's
festivities, it generally fell out that Gertrude
and Willie or Gertrude and Conway, but always
Gertrude, helped to make up the large parties,
without which the American could not be
satisfied and which stirred up and drew together
the social side of Old Keston in an unprecedented
manner.</p>

<p>The weather was glorious, and Gertrude
spent every halfpenny she could scrape together
on white frocks, and though she professed
to hate needlework, she suddenly became
extremely industrious and worked early and
late, turning out dainty blouses which far
outshone Denys's creations and astounded her
family. On Saturday mornings she gave up
all her usual avocations, denied herself to the
general public, and devoted her energies to the
wash-tub and the ironing board, the result
of which operations she proudly displayed in
a pile of muslins which would have done credit
to an experienced laundry-maid.</p>

<p>"People think I can't do things," she said
complacently to her mother, "Denys is not
the only one who can get up frocks and make
blouses."</p>

<p>"Very likely not," muttered Conway, who
overheard the remark, "you only do them when
it is for yourself. Denys does them every
day for everybody else."</p>

<p>Gertrude carefully laid by her freshly got
up stock of elegancies, and stretched her tired
back on the bed which they had occupied,
hoping to get half an hour's sleep before she
dressed for a picnic.</p>

<p>"Money would have sent all those horrid
frills to the laundry and saved me a backache,"
she said to herself, "frills are bad enough to
make, but they are infinitely worse to iron.
Of course I want money to do things with! I
don't want to be poor all my life."</p>

<p>Then she smiled as she closed her eyes and
composed herself to sleep.</p>

<p>"I believe I really <em>am</em> having my chance,"
she reflected. "I know pretty nearly everybody
who is worth knowing here now."</p>

<p>And then, as so often happened when Gertrude
contemplated her matrimonial prospects, a
vision of Reggie Alston rose up before her,
and disturbed her serenity.</p>

<p>"Reggie <em>was</em> a nice boy&#8212;it is a pity he is
poor," she thought regretfully, and then she
suddenly sprang into a sitting posture, all
thought of sleep completely banished from her
mind.</p>

<p>Reggie's birthday! It had come and gone
weeks ago and she had missed it&#8212;she had
completely forgotten it! What must Reggie
have thought?</p>

<p>She glanced at the clock; there was just
time to scribble a note before she dressed
for the picnic, and of course, though she had
no wish to encourage Reggie's friendship, yet
a birthday was a special occasion, and had
she remembered it she would certainly have
written!</p>

<p>Why, it was on Easter Monday! No wonder
she had forgotten it! Mrs. Henchman had
sent all her young party and several other
friends off for a lovely expedition to an old
castle, and Audrey had been hostess and had
felt herself tied to the luncheon basket and
the elder guests, while Cecil Greyburne and
Gertrude had wandered about together all
day and she had never once thought of
Reggie.</p>

<p>But she ought to have written on the Friday
or Saturday. She remembered how they had
all come in late from a long walk, and Cecil had
discovered that the country post had gone out,
and he had not sent off a particular letter and
an Easter card. He had fumed and worried
to such an extent that she had thought it
really unnecessary, and wondered whoever could
be of such importance to him. Then Charlie
had recollected that there was a later country
post in Dennetford and Cecil had sat down at
Charlie's desk and written furiously, and
enclosed a lovely Easter card&#8212;Gertrude had
seen enough of it to know that&#8212;and then,
without waiting for even a cup of tea, he had
ridden off to Dennetford as if his very life
depended on catching that post!</p>

<p>If she had only thought of Reggie's birthday,
Cecil would have posted the letter with his,
as he posted one for Charlie.</p>

<p>She went hot all over as she suddenly realised
that Charlie's letter must have been a birthday
letter for Reggie. She distinctly remembered
Charlie's words,</p>

<p>"It will reach Scotland on Monday morning."</p>

<p>Charlie might have reminded her!</p>

<p>Hastily now she gathered her writing
materials and wrote Reggie his long delayed
birthday letter, and in her haste and regret
she forgot all about her casual on-the-top-of-things
style, and though the letter was very
short it was just such a letter as she had written
him before these new ideas came into her head.
"I am rushing off to a picnic with the Stacey
people, so cannot write more," she ended up.
"We are going to the Roman Hill. Do you
remember how we went there last year and
what a jolly time we had?"</p>

<p>Simple words&#8212;and yet Reggie treasured
them like gold-dust.</p>

<p>Gertrude posted her letter on her way to
the Stacey's house and she felt vaguely relieved
when it slipped from her fingers into the chasm
of the red pillar box. She felt that now she
could enjoy herself in peace.</p>

<p>She was the most popular, the most sought-after
girl at the picnic that afternoon; she
was never short of a cavalier to wait on her
lightest behest; she was her prettiest, her most
charming self. The American whispered to her
that a picnic without her would be a desolation
and he had half a mind to stop another week
at his aunt's&#8212;but Gertrude was not enjoying
herself. From behind the gorse bushes, from
between the moss-grown boulders, from beneath
the dark foliage of the Scotch firs, there peeped
at her a ghost.</p>

<p>She saw it everywhere. It was the ghost
of Reggie Alston.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday; always a quiet
home day in the St. Olave's household, and in
the little interval between tea-time and evening
service the whole family were gathered in the
cool shaded drawing-room, reading, or listening
to Gertrude's description of the yesterday's
picnic. Suddenly she broke in upon her own
narrative with a question&#8212;</p>

<p>"Mother, how did you and father happen
to meet and like one another?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brougham smiled as she glanced over
at Mr. Brougham.</p>

<p>"My dear!" she said, "that's a very old
story!"</p>

<p>"Mother won't tell it!" said Willie in his
slow, drawly way, "so I will; I know all about
it. Father made up his mind that there was
nobody like mother in all the world, but prospects
were bad in England and he did not see
how he could buy the furniture, so he did not
say a word to anybody except to his own
mother, and he went to China and saved up,
and in four years he came back because the
firm shut up shop, and the first thing he heard
when he got back, was that mother was going
into a big hospital to train as a nurse, and he
said to himself, 'One of those doctors will take
a fancy to her, as sure as sure,' so he put on
his best clothes and rushed off&#8212;and&#8212;and&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Proposed," ended up Gertrude. "Of course
I know all that as well as you do. What I
want to know is before all that."</p>

<p>"Now it is my turn," said Mr. Brougham
looking up from his book, "before that, mother
used to give music lessons to my little step-sister
and brother&#8212;and two more rampageous
little mortals I never came across&#8212;and they
were always in hot water with their masters
and mistresses. But whatever they did, she
was so patient and gentle&#8212;though she made
them mind her too&#8212;but she never spoke
sharply or raised her voice. I used to stand
on the stairs outside the drawing-room door,
to be sure that they were not very naughty
to her, and I made up my mind then. When
true love comes to bless us, it is generally
through some little everyday thing, some
strength or tenderness of character, some
simple good quality, some sympathetic tone,
or some unselfish act."</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun it would have been if mother
had come out and caught you," cried Tony
exultantly.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Charlie chose Denys for,"
murmured Gertrude.</p>

<p>"Really!" said Denys, flushing and rising,
"this conversation is getting altogether too
personal. Come, Maudie, it is your bedtime."</p>

<p>She carried the child off, and Conway said a
little pointedly&#8212;</p>

<p>"I wonder what anybody could choose
Gertrude for."</p>

<p>Gertrude coloured angrily and his mother
said gently, "Conway, dear!"</p>

<p>"Well!" said Willie's drawly voice again,
"I should like to know what a girl looks for
in a fellow. What should you expect, for
instance, Gertrude?"</p>

<p>One word rose involuntarily to Gertrude's
lips, but she choked it back.</p>

<p>"My dear Willie!" she said with her easy
laugh.</p>

<p>And that same word had risen to Conway's
lips, but with a tremendous effort he too choked
it back. Gertrude always aggravated him, and
it was a daily fight with him to be civil to her.</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and went into the garden,
and in a few minutes the others drifted after
him, and Mr. and Mrs. Brougham were left alone.</p>

<p>"It is nice to see them all together like
this," said Mrs. Brougham fondly, as she
watched the moving figures in the garden.</p>

<p>There was a smile in Mr. Brougham's eyes
as he quoted&#8212;</p>

<p>"We shan't have to part with little Maud&#8212;yet,"
answered Mrs. Brougham with a low
laugh.</p>

<p>There did not rise before her mental vision
a picture of a vengeful woman cowering over
a handful of red embers, her mind set on one
object and one object only&#8212;some mode of
vengeance.</p>

<p>But even if she could have seen such a picture,
how could she have formed a chain of association
which should link that woman with the
maid in her own kitchen, or with the golden-haired
child upstairs, the patter of whose little
feet sounded over her head?</p>

<p>How the patter of those childish footsteps
came back to her heart's memory on Monday
night!</p>

<p>"No," repeated Mr. Brougham thoughtfully,
"not yet!"</p>

<h2>MEETING AND PARTING.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Monday morning brought a letter for Gertrude
in a distinctly masculine, but quite unfamiliar
handwriting.</p>

<p>Its very unfamiliarity made her let it lie
unopened beside her plate while she began her
breakfast. If anyone showed curiosity about
her correspondent she could truthfully say she
did not know who the letter was from, and she
liked to amuse herself with wondering about
it. Even the postmark was obliterated. She
decided then that the rich American, who
really was leaving for Switzerland at last, had
written to say farewell and to tell her when
he was likely to return for the final wind-up
picnic he had promised to Old Keston.</p>

<p>She did not guess that the mysterious writing
was well known to Denys as that of one of
Charlie Henchman's friends, and that she had
said to herself as she carried it in from the
post-box, "What is Cecil Greyburne writing
to Gertrude for?"</p>

<p>At last curiosity overcame Gertrude. All
the family were busy with their breakfast
and their own concerns. Conway and her
father were each buried in a daily paper, Willie
and Tony had lesson books propped in front of
them, little Maud was engrossed in bread and
milk, and Mrs. Brougham and Denys at either
end of the table were pouring out tea, and
cutting bread, and dispensing porridge and
bacon, and generally devoting themselves to
the wants of the family. Nobody was heeding
Gertrude, and she opened her letter and glanced
first at the signature.</p>

<p>Cecil Greyburne!</p>

<p>She was distinctly conscious of a feeling of
disappointment, but in a moment she pushed
that aside. It was pleasant to find Cecil had
not forgotten her, though the note was but a
short one, nothing to compare in length with
the one that had accompanied the Easter card
which he had ridden fast and far to post.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Gertrude</span>," the note ran, "You
know I am always trotting about the country
for my work, and on Monday afternoon I
find I pass through Old Keston station, waiting
three minutes by the official time-table (probably
that will mean five). I meant to call in
and give you all a surprise visit, but find there
is no suitable train to carry me on later. If
some of you are near the station at 5.15 and
can waste a few minutes on a chat, it would
cheer a hot and tiring journey and make it
seem worth while. I shall be in the front of the
train; at least half of me will be, the other half
will be outside the window watching for you.</p>

<div class='center'>
<p class="noindent">"Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap" style="padding-left: 8em;">"Cecil Greyburne."</span></p>
</div>

<p>Monday afternoon at 5.15! Gertrude's
memory rapidly ran through her list of Monday
classes and pupils. One of the pupils was ill
and, a most unusual thing, she would be free
at four o'clock! She need not go to the station
in her school dress, but have time to come home
and put on something pretty. It was very
jolly of Cecil to have thought of writing. Of
course she would go if she possibly could.</p>

<p>She frowned as she wondered whether she
must mention Cecil's request to her mother
and Denys. He had said "some of you,"
but he had written specially to her. She
remembered that Denys always went to help
with a Blanket Club on Monday afternoons
and was seldom home before six o'clock, and
she did not see exactly what interest it would
be to Denys to see Cecil.</p>

<p>At any rate she would leave that decision
till she came home at dinner-time.</p>

<p>At dinner-time she had a bright idea. She
would take little Maud. The care of Maud on
Monday afternoons devolved on Mrs. Brougham,
and Gertrude knew that a proposal to
take the child out would be very welcome, and
it would fulfil Cecil's "some of you." Cecil
would like to see the family pet.</p>

<p>So Denys went on unsuspectingly to the
Blanket Club, and at four o'clock Gertrude
turned up at home, announced that for a
wonder she had an hour off, that she was going
up to the station and that she would take
Maud with her, if Mrs. Brougham liked.</p>

<p>Then she arrayed herself in her freshest
muslin and most becoming hat, curled up
Maud's ringlets and dressed her in a clean
and dainty frock, put her in her little wheel
chair, and catching up a library book to change
at the station, as a sort of excuse, started
forth to see Cecil.</p>

<p>Her mother came to the gate with them
both and stood watching them down the road,
thinking to herself what a pretty pair they
made, and at the corner they turned and waved
to her, and Gertrude's heart suddenly misgave
her. She wished now that she had made no
secret of Cecil's letter, she had even half a
mind to run back and ask her mother to come
with them and see Cecil, or at any rate, to
send a message of kind regards to him, but
as she hesitated, thinking how astonished her
mother would be that she had not mentioned
it before, Mrs. Brougham, with a final smile and
wave of the hand, turned back to the house,
and the chiming of the church clock sounding
out warned Gertrude that it was far later
than she had guessed it could be.</p>

<p>Five o'clock! How <em>could</em> she have been
so long getting ready?</p>

<p>It was fifteen minutes' steady walk to the
station, and the church clock was often slow,
but then the train was sure to be late!</p>

<p>Comforting herself with this reflection Gertrude
hurried along, hating to look hot and
flurried, and yet more and more determined
not to be too late, even if she had to run for it.</p>

<p>And run for it she did, for the signal was
down when it came into view a hundred yards
away from the station, and as she entered the
booking office she saw the engine of Cecil's
train rounding the last bend of the line, and
there were the steps and the subway between
her and the down platform.</p>

<p>If she waited to unfasten Maud's strap, to
lift her out, and carry her down the steps and
up the steps, she would miss Cecil. The thought
came to her unbidden as the train thundered
in, and hastily pushing the wheel chair into a
corner by the booking office window, she bade
the child look through and see all the lovely
big trains, till Gertrude came back in a minute.
Then she flew down the steps and through the
subway and was rushing up the other side
when an unexpected voice arrested her steps.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Gertrude. I was just
wishing to see you. What are you in such a
flurry for? There is another three minutes
before the train goes!"</p>

<p>"I've to meet someone," explained Gertrude
hurriedly, "I'll come and see you, Mrs. Parsons.
I can't stay now."</p>

<p>She ran on, and Mrs. Parsons followed her
leisurely. She liked to know everybody's business
and she lived opposite the Stacey's and
had observed that Gertrude had attended every
festivity provided by the American cousin,
while her own daughter had been invited only
once. She had also heard that the American
was leaving for Switzerland to-day, and she
immediately jumped to the conclusion that
Gertrude had come to see him off. So she
strolled along the platform and made her
observations.</p>

<p>No, it was not the American, but it was a
young fellow; a tall and pleasant-looking
fellow too. He stood on the platform, one
hand on the open door of the carriage, talking
eagerly to Gertrude, and Mrs. Parsons stationed
herself at a moderate distance, partly screened
by a pile of luggage, and waited. She wished
the engine would cease blowing off steam,
she could perhaps have caught snatches of
that interesting conversation, for she had
wonderful hearing, besides an imagination.</p>

<p>"I was awfully disappointed I could not call
and see you all," Cecil was saying, "I seem to
know you all through Charlie and Denys.
I hoped Denys would have come with you,
but I suppose she was too busy. I saw Charlie
yesterday and I had heaps of messages for her."</p>

<p>Gertrude coloured, "I'm sorry!" she said,
a little nettled that he should be unsatisfied
with her company, "you didn't mention Denys
specially and she is always at the Blanket
Club on Mondays, so I didn't even tell her I
was coming, but I did bring Maudie, only we
got late somehow and there wasn't time to
bring her round, so I left her on the other side
in the booking office."</p>

<p>"Here's twopence to get her out again,"
laughed Cecil, "Well! better luck next time.
I suppose you got late by making yourself so
fetching!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" answered Gertrude with a tiny
bit of starch in her tone, but the next moment
she laughed, and asked him when he would
be making the return journey.</p>

<p>So the minutes slipped by till their chat
was overpowered by the rush and roar of a
train coming in on the up side and there was a
sudden waving of flags and shouting by porters
of "Take your seats," along Cecil's train.</p>

<p>"Hullo! we're off!" he exclaimed as he
jumped on to the footboard, "we were waiting
for that train to cross I suppose, but they gave
us a jolly long three minutes; its been quite
six, I should say. I knew they would. It's
awfully good of you to come down and see me.
Give my love to everybody. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" she echoed, "mind you write
when you come through again, and see if I
don't bring Denys and Maud and mother and
anybody else I can lay hold of, to meet you!"</p>

<p>"All right!" he said, "that's a promise!"</p>

<p>The train moved and she stood back smiling
and waving, watching him till the train passed
round the bend. Then she turned, and
encountered Mrs. Parsons.</p>

<p>"I thought I would wait for you, my dear.
It is a pity to trouble you to call when you
must have so <em>many</em> engagements. It is only
a matter of a couple of words."</p>

<p>"Then I must get you to come round to the
booking office," said Gertrude, trying to hide her
annoyance, "for I have little Maud waiting for
me, and she will think I am never coming back."</p>

<p>They passed down the steps and up the other
side to the booking office, and Gertrude, entering
first, went quickly to the corner where she
had left her little sister.</p>

<p>"Well, Maudie!" she said cheerfully, "did
you think I&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>She stopped short, aghast. There was the
wheel chair, just as she had left it, but it was
empty. Little Maud was not there.</p>

<p>"Maud!" she said, looking round into every
corner as if the child might be hiding. "Maud!
wherever are you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. The office was empty
except for the wheel chair.</p>

<p>Gertrude glanced up and down the platform,
then out at the door that stood open to the
road. Then she knocked at the office door.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of my little
sister?" she asked, "I left her in that chair
five minutes or so ago, and I can't think what
has became of her."</p>

<p>The clerk shook his head.</p>

<p>"I didn't see her," he said, "I was giving
out tickets for the up train. There was a
terrific scrimmage between two dogs&#8212;no end
of a row. Perhaps your brother or your father
came in by the up train and took the child
home. It was enough to frighten anybody
to hear the lady that the little dog belonged
to! She was right down screaming for somebody
to rescue her dog."</p>

<p>"It might be that," assented Gertrude. All
her bright colour had departed, she looked pale
and anxious, and such an upset of her nicely
laid plans was extremely annoying. Besides,
she might be very much blamed for leaving
Maud alone.</p>

<p>"Well! I'm not going to wheel home that
empty chair," said she, "you might keep it
for me till to-morrow."</p>

<p>Then she turned to Mrs. Parsons. It was
an aggravation of annoyance to have her as a
witness of these <em>contretemps</em>.</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs. Parsons!" she said sharply,
"I cannot attend to any business to-night.
I must get home and see about Maud. It's
very thoughtless of Conway to take her off
without my knowing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parsons had quite intended to accompany
Gertrude to St. Olave's and see the end of
the story, and she was highly offended at
Gertrude's tone.</p>

<p>So she turned homewards alone and she told
the story in her own way.</p>

<p>Gertrude's footsteps grew quicker and
quicker as she neared St. Olave's. It seemed
to her that a string was being tied round her
neck so tightly that she could scarcely get her
breath.</p>

<p>If Conway had taken Maud home, why had
he left the wheel chair?</p>

<p>On the doorstep she paused to pull herself
together. It was ridiculous to be so nervous.</p>

<p>She went straight to the dining-room. Her
mother and Denys were sitting peacefully at
tea.</p>

<p>"Are father or Conway home?" she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, they expect to be late," answered
Mrs. Brougham serenely.</p>

<p>"Have you been up to the station, Denys?"</p>

<p>"No," said Denys, glancing up wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Nor Pattie?"</p>

<p>"No! whatever is the matter, Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"Somebody has taken Maud!"</p>

<h2><a name="xviii" id="xviii"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h2>A BASE TRICK.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Jim Adams could not make out what had
changed his wife, but changed she was.</p>

<p>It might have been a dream that she had
threatened vengeance on Pattie, for she now
never mentioned her, and she treated Tom
with a politeness and a thoughtfulness that
made Jim believe she repented her interview
with Pattie, and wished Tom to forget it.
She might even have herself forgotten what
she had said about paying Pattie out. She
had undoubtedly had a few glasses the night
Tom came in to see Harry, and that was enough
to account for uncontrolled words, and forgetfulness
of them.</p>

<p>Jane had also ceased to grumble at Harry's
presence, and she cooked Jim appetising suppers
as of old and she even spoke pleasantly to
Harry. Jim fondly imagined that she was
becoming as devoted to the bright, engaging
little fellow as he was himself, and he could
not know that in his absence hard words and
frequent blows became the child's portion
whenever his aunt happened to be annoyed
with him or anybody else.</p>

<p>Jim little guessed the real reasons that lurked
beneath Jane's changed and pleasant behaviour.
The truth was that her thirst for vengeance
and her desire for strong drink were growing
together, and with them&#8212;for it was allied to
both of them&#8212;cunning grew.</p>

<p>On that evening when Jim had summarily
marched her into her bed-room, she had been
enraged beyond words, and had the two men
not taken their immediate departure, there
is no saying what might have happened.</p>

<p>But while she waited for Jim's return she
had time for reflection.</p>

<p>Aided by the inspiriting action of the supper
beer, she had thought over the situation, and
before the inspiriting effect had gone off, and
the lowering, muddling effect had come on,
she came to the conclusion that she would be
making a great mistake if she allowed Tom or
Jim to know her intentions against Pattie.
What was the use of all her plans and determination,
if they interfered and spoilt it all?
They must think it was only an empty threat,
and by and by they would forget it.</p>

<p>That settled the matter of the desire for
vengeance, and she forthwith brooded over it in
silence, till it became part of her very existence.</p>

<p>The thirst for strong drink touched her
relations towards Harry. She was finding the
extra money that Jim gave her for the child
most useful. She scarcely missed his food,
for he ate but little, and his share was usually
what would otherwise have been wasted. Jane
was not of a thrifty turn of mind, but the
money was hard, solid cash, and gave her a
free hand for spending on that in which her
soul most delighted.</p>

<p>It was therefore necessary to make the child
at least apparently comfortable, or Jim might
take it into his head to board him out. Any
woman among her neighbours would have
taken the boy for less than Jane had
demanded for his keep.</p>

<p>With these reasons to help the most powerful
influences of her life, Jane kept an oiled tongue
and an even temper, and like the calm before
the storm, it made things pleasanter for those
around her.</p>

<p>Little Harry quickly discovered that it was
safer to play in the street when Aunt Jane
was alone, but that there was no need for fear
if Uncle Jim or Uncle Tom were at home.
He was a cheerful little soul too, and began to
enjoy such pleasures as came into his new
life and to forget the old. Saturday, Sunday
and Monday were his joy-days, for on Saturday
Uncle Tom always came and took him out for
some excursion or treat, or if it were wet, to his
own home.</p>

<p>On Sunday Uncle Jim sent him to a Mission
Sunday School, morning and afternoon, and
sometimes, greatest treat of all, in the evening
Uncle Jim would take him to the Mission
Service. That Mission Service had a home-like
feeling to little Harry, for it reminded
him of the Sailor's Rest where he had so often
gone with his mother at Whitecliff, before her
cough got worse.</p>

<p>He loved the singing there, and at Sunday
School. He had a voice like a little bird,
sweet and true and clear, and sometimes
when Aunt Jane was out on Sunday evening,
Uncle Jim would let him sing to him, and
even Aunt Jane would let him sing the
baby to sleep of a night.</p>

<p>There was one hymn that he learned at
Sunday School that he was never tired of
singing. It had a chorus, and he always
fancied that it was the baby's favourite, too&#8212;</p>

<p>On Mondays Harry went to the Mixham
Nursery. Harry thought it a charming place.
There were no big rough boys or girls&#8212;only
little people like himself, and the tables were
little and the seats were little, and there were
toys, and somebody besides himself to make
a grand play and pretend to be soldiers, or
engine-drivers or horses.</p>

<p>There was a kind-faced woman there, who
put pretty clean pinafores on all the children
when they came in the morning, and there was
always something nice for dinner.</p>

<p>There was a room for the babies upstairs,
which Harry considered a most suitable arrangement,
and he saw his baby cousin carried up
there with great content. He wished Aunt
Jane would go out washing every day till
Saturday!</p>

<p>Dinner-time was twelve o'clock, and Harry,
having learned to tell the time, and having
taken a great fancy to the seat at the end
of the long, low table, always took his place at
least five minutes before twelve, to ensure its
possession, and such is the force of example
and the love of the best available seat, that
on Mondays there was no need for the matron
to say, "Come to dinner, children," for a row
of little eager faces lined the table, and a row
of little hands were folded reverently upon it,
waiting for her to ask a blessing.</p>

<p>And after dinner came the only drawback
which Harry found in the Nursery life.</p>

<p>He and all the other children had to take
a good long nap.</p>

<p>On one side of the room was a sort of pen,
with mattresses and blankets, and into this
the children were tucked, the room was
darkened, talking was forbidden and in a very
few minutes they were all asleep, and silence
and peace reigned.</p>

<p>"It keeps them good-tempered, and it rests
the nurses," the smiling matron used to
say.</p>

<p>Eight o'clock seemed to come much earlier
on Monday night than on any other, and with
the hour came Aunt Jane for the baby, and
Harry's bliss was over till Saturday should
dawn again, but after all it was not long from
Monday night to Saturday morning, only
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday!</p>

<p>These pleasant summer days were bringing
to Jim, too, a smooth and easy-going existence&#8212;just
the existence that suited his easy-going
temperament. And then, partly through the
very smoothness of these days, partly on
account of his great satisfaction in his own
strength in keeping a resolve, there arose in
Jim's life a little cloud, no bigger than a man's
hand.</p>

<p>He had been a total abstainer such a long
time now. He had so often resisted Jane's
repeated invitations to share the supper beer,
that she had ceased to offer it. The old liking
for strong drink did not assail him now. He
even mentioned with a superior little laugh to
his mates, that there had been a time when
he had liked his glass a trifle overmuch, but
now he had given it up for good and all.</p>

<p>And the very next day they played a trick
on him.</p>

<p>He was extremely fond of cold coffee, and
generally brought a can of it with him for
his dinner, and one very hot morning he set it
down on a great stone in a shady corner of
the workshop to keep it cool.</p>

<p>And when dinner-time came, being thirsty,
the first thing he did was to take a long pull
at his can. He had swallowed half its contents
at one draught, before he realised what had
happened.</p>

<p>The mystified, horrified expression on his
face as he set the can down, was almost
ludicrous; to his mates who were all in the
secret, it was irresistibly funny.</p>

<p>There was a roar of delighted laughter, and
Jim's eyes blazed with anger as he glared at the
can he still grasped in his hand.</p>

<p>Yes! It was his own can, and they had taken
away his coffee and filled it with beer! He had
been basely tricked. He stood there realising
it, while the roars of laughter were sobering
down into words.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! old teetotaller! That's the
best fun we ever had!"</p>

<p>"Jolly good coffee! isn't it, Jim? If you
could only have seen your own face!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, old chap! You can be a
teetotaller again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I won't!" said Jim angrily, "I did try.
Now I don't care what happens."</p>

<p>He gathered up his dinner basket and the
can of beer, and stalked away, and a silence
fell upon the little group of workmen as they
watched him.</p>
<br />
<br />
<hr style="width: 50%;" />
<br />
<h2><a name="xix" id="xix"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h2>A SUCCESSFUL RAID.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Jim Adams stuck to his threat. He ceased to
be an abstainer, and life changed at once for
himself and for all those with whom he came in
contact.</p>

<p>He was morose with his mates, and withdrew
from their company as much as possible. He
shared the supper beer with Jane, but he
constantly spoke sharply to her and especially
resented the least inattention to Harry's wants,
so that it seemed as if the two had changed
places, and now it was Jim who found fault
and Jane who, aided by that secret object in
her mind, took it quietly and made the best of
things.</p>

<p>To Harry, Jim was never cross, but the child
felt a difference, and missed the companionship
Jim had given him, for now Jim either called in
at the public-house on his way home from work,
or, returning early, went out immediately after
supper, and he ceased to take an interest in
the Mission Service or in Harry's singing.</p>

<p>Jim was bitterly disappointed with himself.
He had been trying to be good like his little
sister Nellie, to be good enough to meet her in
Heaven, and now he had been tricked into
doing what he had no intention of doing, and
the old liking had come back with the old
taste. He had emptied the rest of that can of
beer with real relish, for in his anger he had
carried it away to finish it with his dinner, and
in that finishing of it, he had gone under to the
old temptation.</p>

<p>He had fought and failed. If, in his anger
at the base trickery of his mates, he had dashed
the can of beer on the ground, he would not
have despised himself, he could have forgiven
himself; but he knew perfectly well that,
even as the unexpected liquid poured down
his throat, and he realised what it was, he had
made up his mind to finish it, come what
might.</p>

<p>He said to himself moodily that men and
the devil had combined against him, and
what was the use of fighting any more?</p>

<p>He only hoped that Tom would not guess.
He knew Tom would be disappointed in him,
and he avoided seeing him if he was able.
Besides, he knew all Tom could say to him,
but he did not mean to try to be a teetotaller
again.</p>

<p>And Tom did guess. But he said nothing,
for with his wise, kind eyes he saw that the
time had not come, only, as he went to and
from his work, many an earnest prayer went
up from Tom's heart that Jim might try again,
not this time in his own strength, but in the
strength of that One who had died to redeem
him from all iniquity; that he might one day
say, "I will go forth in the strength of the
Lord God."</p>

<p>So Tom came and went to Jim's home as
regularly as ever on a Saturday, and took
Harry out with him. Though he seldom found
Jim in, and the very sight of Jane and the
sound of her voice, brought back the shiver to
his heart that had come to it when he knew
she had seen and spoken to Pattie, yet he
persevered in coming for the child. If things
were not going too well with Jim, little Harry
needed the more love and guardianship, for
was not this a little life that must one day grow
to good or to evil?</p>

<p>He was thankful that Jane never mentioned
Pattie, but he little guessed that her thoughts
were ever hovering round the idea of vengeance
for his wrongs, like a moth about a candle.</p>

<p>One Monday evening, Jane returned from
her work in Old Keston, full of wrath and
dismay.</p>

<p>She had received a week's notice from her
lady, and no reason, adequate in Jane's mind,
had been given for the change. This made
her furious, for though washing jobs were
plentiful, one that suited her as well as this
was rare, and she would also lose her vantage
ground of keeping an eye on Pattie and finding
a chance of paying her out.</p>

<p>Only one Monday remained to her, but
rack her brains as she would, no way of working
her will occurred to her. Yet if she once lost
sight of Pattie, small chance of doing anything
would remain.</p>

<p>The last Monday came, and all day Jane
kept a sharp look-out on Pattie's premises;
but Pattie had eyes as well as Jane Adams,
and she took very good care that Mondays
never took her down the garden within reach
of Jane's tongue. Yet the very proximity
of Tom's sister on Mondays brought him before
Pattie's mind and made her remember that
phrase which had seemed like music to her,
"going thin and a-fretting for a worthless
thing like you."</p>

<p>Yes! she was but a worthless thing&#8212;only
Tom had not thought so. He had loved her.
Sam Willard liked her, but if she had not gone
out with him on Sunday evening after church,
he would have asked somebody else to go,
and laughed and talked nonsense and enjoyed
himself just the same, scarcely heeding the
difference of his companion. Sam was never
free on Saturday evening as Tom used to be.
She wondered what Tom did with his Saturdays
now. She would like, unseen herself, to see
Tom for just a moment. She wondered if he
ever thought of her now. It was almost worth
risking meeting Jane to know that!</p>

<p>Watch as she would, however, Jane saw
nothing of Pattie till about four o'clock that
Monday afternoon, and then she saw her bustle
out into the garden, and begin vigorously
brushing and dusting a child's wheel chair.
It was but a few minutes' work and Pattie
took the chair inside again, but a few moments
later she reappeared at her bed-room window,
and throwing the sash up she brought a hat
and a brush to the sill and brushed the hat
vigorously. Clearly Pattie and the child were
going out for a walk! At any rate, if she could
but meet them on her way to the station,
Jane thought she could annoy Pattie pretty
considerably.</p>

<p>She had meant to have a few words with
her lady about her dismissal, but her lady had
taken the opportunity to go out calling and
left the maid to pay Mrs. Adams, and Jane
scarcely regretted it, so anxious was she to be
off before Pattie's walk should be over.</p>

<p>However, though she looked up and down
every road she passed on her way to the station,
she saw no sign of Pattie, and the station
bell warning her of her train, she hurried on
She did not want to lose it and wait an
hour.</p>

<p>She found the booking office in an uproar.
In the centre of the crowd of people gathered
for this train, the greatest favourite in the day
for Mixham Junction, a terrible dog-fight was
going on between a big Irish terrier and a small
black terrier, and the small dog was getting
the worst of it.</p>

<p>In vain the lady who owned the small dog,
begged and besought the onlookers to rescue
her pet; nobody seemed to own the Irish
terrier, and the majority of the passengers,
being working men, carried neither sticks nor
umbrellas, and nobody appeared to be inclined
to interfere otherwise with so formidable-looking
an antagonist. Into the midst of this
hubbub came Jane, and the first thing her
eyes fell upon was a frightened child, in a little
wheel chair in a corner under the window,
who was sobbing loudly with absolute terror.</p>

<p>Pattie's little charge!</p>

<p>Jane recognised the child and the chair
in an instant, and looked round for Pattie.
As she did so the Mixham Junction train
thundered in, adding tenfold to the noise
and confusion, the dog-fight lost its interest
in a moment for the onlookers, and they
streamed out on to the platform, mingling and
struggling with the passengers who were
alighting.</p>

<p>One glance showed Jane that Pattie was not
in sight. Her opportunity of vengeance had
come to her. She recognised it, triumphed in
it, all in the flash of a moment, and bending
over little terrified, crying Maud, she unfastened
her strap with a touch, lifted her out, and
saying aloud,</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear, it's all over now," she
stepped swiftly across the platform and entered
a third class carriage.</p>

<p>"Right!" shouted a porter, banging the
door behind her. There was a moment's pause&#8212;a
moment for reflection&#8212;a moment to go
back, but Jane did not take it. She had paid
Pattie out at last.</p>

<p>The carriage was full of people, and they
looked at the sobbing child, some with curiosity,
some with annoyance, but Jane was equal to
the occasion.</p>

<p>She settled the child on her lap, wiped
her wet eyes and set her hat straight, and
then she faced a kind-looking lady who sat
opposite.</p>

<p>"There's been two dogs fighting in there
and it's frightened her," she said. "Never
mind, my dear, it's all over now."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go in the train, I want to
go home," cried Maud, struggling to get off this
strange woman's knee, "I want to go home.
I want my mother," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, my dear!" said Jane authoritatively,
giving her an admonitory little shake.
Then she looked apologetically at the kind
lady again.</p>

<p>"She don't like leaving her mother&#8212;but
there's a new baby sister at her home," she
said glibly, "so she's coming home with me
for a bit. But she's been spoilt and she don't
like the idea of a new baby at all, and she
ain't used to her auntie yet, and then there
was the dogs on top of it all! Hush, my dear,
hush, you're disturbing the ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>She was relieved when the whole carriage
load turned out at the next station: she and
Maud were left alone, and she had time to
collect her thoughts.</p>

<p>Her triumph was complete! She had paid
Pattie out thoroughly and she was satisfied.
The opportunity for her vengeance had come
to her and she had seized it without fear and
without regret. How clever it was of her to
have thought of that fiction about her sister
and the new baby! It would do for Jim too,
admirably, and he would never find out. She
doubted if he even knew where in the outskirts
of Old Keston her sister lived. He might even
not know her married name! He would accept
the story as she gave it, especially now that
he was beginning to drink again. Well! he
could drink as much as he liked, so long as he
brought her her money and Harry's money
regularly!</p>

<p>In a day or two she would take the child
back to Old Keston, ostensibly to see its mother
and the new baby, but in reality she would
take it in the dark to its own gate, and leave it
to make its own presence known.</p>

<p>In the meantime Pattie would be dismissed
without a character, with a multitude of blame
upon her head, if indeed she escaped so easily.
They might think Pattie had stolen the child,
and clap her into prison till she was found!</p>

<p>That would be vengeance indeed!</p>

<h2>REAPING THE WHIRLWIND.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>"It is worse than death," sobbed Mrs.
Brougham, and they all felt that it was so.</p>

<p>They were gathered at home at last, in the
small hours of the night, for there was nothing
more that they could do till morning came to
wake the world again&#8212;that wide desolate
world of houses and roads, of byways and
slums; that world in which, <em>somewhere</em>, was
their little Maud.</p>

<p>Pale, wide-eyed and silent, they all tried to
eat the supper which Pattie, pale and wide-eyed
too, set before them, for they thought of
the day that would soon dawn, when they
would need their strength to begin the search
again, and though it seemed horrible to be
seeking rest in their comfortable beds while
their little sister's fate was unsolved, yet for
that same reason, slowly and lingeringly they
all said good-night and crept upstairs.</p>

<p>For in vain they had searched for little
Maud all the evening long. Police, neighbours,
friends, had all helped, but no trace,
not even the faintest clue, had come to light.
Porters, booking-clerks, railway officials, cabmen,
had all been questioned to no purpose.
Everybody talked about the dog-fight, nobody
had even seen a child, though a porter averred
that he had seen the empty chair long before
the dogs came on the scene, and a workman that
there had been no chair there at all when the
up-train came in. He had stood on the very
spot where the chair was supposed to be,
watching through the window for a friend,
with his bag of tools on the ground beside
him. He had moved forward to speak to his
friend, and returning a few moments later
when the train had gone, to take up the tools,
had then noticed the empty chair.</p>

<p>What had become of the child was a complete
mystery! Every house of the Broughams'
acquaintance was visited, in the forlorn hope
that someone had taken Maud home with
them, but the answer was always the same.
Telegrams were sent to all the stations on the
line, both up and down, but the hour between
five and six held the busiest trains of the day,
and in the rush of passengers, augmented by
gangs of working men returning to their homes,
there was small chance of a ticket collector
having leisure to observe the children who
passed through his gate.</p>

<p>No one at home said a word of blame to
Gertrude. There was no need. They had
heard the whole story and they only pitied her,
and her grief was far greater than their own,
they thought, for there was no self-blame,
no shadow of deception, no regret of wilfulness
in their sorrow. Even Conway felt unutterably
tender towards this least dear of his sisters,
when he came in from a fruitless errand, and
found the proud, dark head resting on little
Maud's high chair, while Gertrude's whole
frame shook with sobs.</p>

<p>"Don't cry so!" he said gently, and he
found it hard to keep his own voice steady.
"Don't cry so, poor old girl. God knows
where she is and He'll take care of her. I
keep on saying that to myself, for I know
He will."</p>

<p>"If only I had told them all about Cecil, it
would not have been so bad," sobbed Gertrude.</p>

<p>And Conway could not answer. He only
patted her shoulder kindly and went upstairs
to find his mother.</p>

<p>The days dragged along their weary hours
after that and no news came of Maud.</p>

<p>The Broughams felt as if an earthquake had
come into their lives, leaving them all uprooted;
as if nothing could let them settle down to the
old routine of life till Maud came back, and
without even putting it into words to each
other, they all looked drearily forward into
days and weeks and months and years, and
pictured Maud as never coming back, but
growing up somewhere, somehow, with somebody.
Truly it was worse than death.</p>

<p>Gladly would they have pulled down their
blinds and darkened the house and put on
mourning.</p>

<p>When Jerry died, it had not been like this.
They wept and sorrowed for him, but they
laid him to rest in sure and certain hope of a
joyful resurrection. He was safe. It was the
uncertainty of Maud's fate, her surroundings,
her associates, the awful uncertainty of everything
concerning her, that made this trial so
unbearable, that it seemed to every one of
them that they could not bear it for another
day.</p>

<p>Yet God knew. The only comfort they had,
came to them in that thought.</p>

<p>Their friends were kindness itself; every
sort of sympathy, except the sympathy of
flowers, was offered them. Special prayer was
made in church for those who were "any
ways afflicted or distressed," for the story
was in every one's mouth, and mothers with
little children guarded them jealously, and
thought of what they would feel if one of them
was taken from them as Maud had been.</p>

<p>But outside of her own home no sympathy
was shown to Gertrude.</p>

<p>The place rang with her name. Mrs. Parsons
had gone about with her story of the handsome
young man in the down train, the meeting
with whom Gertrude had not even allowed
her little sister to witness, and the stories grew
and grew on that foundation, till every picnic
or tennis party that Gertrude had attended
that summer, was transformed into a separate
flirtation or supplied an anecdote to Gertrude's
disadvantage.</p>

<p>She had rejoiced at knowing everybody in
Old Keston who was worth knowing, but now
she wished sadly that she was utterly unknown.
She felt that she was pointed at and
whispered about, as "the girl that lost her
little sister."</p>

<p>Pauline Stacey gathered up all the stories and
recounted them to Gertrude with an apologetic
air that meant nothing, but covered her real
enjoyment in the telling of the gossip, and
Gertrude had not the heart to stop her.</p>

<p>After all, what did it matter? Perhaps it
was best to know the worst that was being
said. No one could blame her more than she
blamed herself; she <em>had</em> lost little Maud
through meeting Cecil Greyburne and she had
done it secretly. Only she hoped that all
these other false stories would not reach her
home people's ears.</p>

<p>And not one friend of hers had offered her
any sympathy. She felt it keenly. Even
Pauline only troubled to see her when she had
some fresh tale to relate. Cecil had written
his sympathy to Denys and had ignored Gertrude,
not even sending her a message, for
Gertrude had seen the letter.</p>

<p>The rich American had not referred to it
when he answered Pauline's letter in which
she told him all about Maud, unless his remark
that he should not be back in Old Keston after
all, could be taken as a reference. Nor had
he written a line of condolence to Gertrude, as
she had half hoped he would.</p>

<p>And Reggie did not know anything about it.
He had sent an immediate and cheerful response
to her belated birthday letter, but not having
written to him for so long in her sunny days
of popularity, she was too proud to do so now,
when she was in sorrow.</p>

<p>Yet she watched for a letter from him,
hoping that Charlie would write to him and
tell him of their trouble, and if he once heard
of it, Gertrude knew that a letter would come
by return of post.</p>

<p>But none came. Charlie did not write to
Reggie. How could he do so without attaching
blame to Gertrude?</p>

<p>These were days of darkness, but in them
Pattie shone out like gold. She waited on
them all with love and patience, she kept the
meals regular and the rooms nicely dusted,
and she attended to all the little duties that
no one seemed to think of now-a-days.</p>

<p>It was she who received Maud's empty
chair from the station-clerk, and hid it away
that it might bring no fresh pang of sorrow
to any heart. It was she who unostentatiously
and without fuss, quietly laid by the child's
toys and clothes, for she truly guessed that to
Denys or Mrs. Brougham, to do so would be
like saying a long farewell to their darling, and
yet to see them lying here and there, was a
constant reminder of her loss.</p>

<p>Though the two things seemed to have no
connection with one another, after the day
that Maud was lost, Pattie gave up going out
with Sam Willard.</p>

<p>She said, when he remonstrated with her,
that she had no heart now for palavering and
he had better find someone who was free and
happy. For herself, she could think of nothing
but how to find little Maud again.</p>

<p>"Then you'll be an old maid," said Sam
crossly, "whoever's taken the child has taken
her a-purpose, and they won't run no risks in
returning her. You'll be an old maid if you
throw away all your chances like this."</p>

<p>"Very well!" answered Pattie firmly, "then
I'll <em>be</em> an old maid and a good-tempered one
too. I won't be like some cross-grained
bachelors I know, so there!"</p>

<h2>THE HIDING-PLACE.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Jane did not feel the least shade of regret or
fear when she took Maud home.</p>

<p>There was no one there, of course, for Jim
was at work still and Harry and the baby
were at the Nursery. Jane gave Maud some
bread and jam and a mug of milk and sat
down to think over the situation.</p>

<p>Harry had made his appearance in the house
and street without occasioning the least remark
or surprise. They made no apologies for him,
no explanations beyond the one that he was
Jim's nephew.</p>

<p>This was her niece. That was all the
difference. With no mystery and no explanations
she felt perfectly secure. She would
act exactly as she had done when Harry came.
There was only one thing necessary for protection.
The colour of the child's hair should
be brown and her white dress and sun hat
should be pink!</p>

<p>"What's your name, child?" she said
abruptly.</p>

<p>Maud looked up startled.</p>

<p>"I'm Maudie," she said piteously, her blue
eyes filling with tears, "I don't like being here.
I want to go home to my mother."</p>

<p>She struggled out of her chair, and prepared
to depart, but Jane lifted her back rather
roughly and spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said, "you've got to be a
good girl and do what Aunt Jane tells you,
and if you are a good girl and don't cry, you
shall go home to-morrow; but if you cry, you
shan't!"</p>

<p>She bustled over to a cupboard and began
rummaging, bringing out presently a ball of
pink Dolly dye and a little bottle of deep-red
crystals, while poor little Maud choked back
her tears as best she could. Her short
experience of life had brought prompt fulfilment
of promises, and she watched Jane quite
interestedly, as she threw a few crystals into a
basin, poured boiling water on them, and
produced a lovely crimson liquid.</p>

<p>Jane then tied a towel round the child's neck.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make you some lovely curls,"
she announced, unconsciously using one of
Denys's constant formulas, and in a moment
Maud's golden head was sopped all over with
the crimson liquid, and after it was dried on
the towel, she emerged with fluffy brown curls
and streaks of brown upon her face. That
defect was soon remedied, and the brown stain
travelled all over her face and neck till the
clear white skin had disappeared, and she
looked like all the other little sun-browned
children who ran about in the street below.</p>

<p>Jane surveyed her handiwork with satisfaction;
then she rapidly undressed her new
charge, put her into one of Harry's nightdresses,
tucked her up into Harry's bed, and turned her
attention to the frock and hat, and when they
were hanging on the line, pink and damp,
she cleared up the room and wished Jim would
make haste and come home. She wanted to
get her explanations to him over before she
fetched Harry and the baby.</p>

<p>But no Jim came, and at last she went
downstairs and knocked at a neighbour's door.</p>

<p>"I say," she said, "I wish you'd fetch my
baby and the brat from the Nursery for me.
My husband's not in yet, and I've brought
my sister's child home along of me for a few
days, and he don't know a word about it. If he
was to come in while I was out, he might be
putting the child outside in the street."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said the woman carelessly. "My
word, Jane Adams, but I thought you hated
children!"</p>

<p>"So I do!" answered Jane fiercely, "but
he <em>would</em> have his sister's, now it's my turn for
<em>my</em> sister's!"</p>

<p>As she turned up the stairs her own words
came back to her with a sudden qualm. Her
sister's child! What about Tom?</p>

<p>He would know that this was not his sister's
child&#8212;he might even know whose child it
was, for he must probably have seen it with
Pattie!</p>

<p>But even as the disquieting thought came,
a reassuring one followed. Tom was gone
away for a month on a special job for his master,
and long before that time had elapsed, Pattie
would be dismissed and the child could be
returned.</p>

<p>Jim did not come home till very late, and
when he did, he was more than half intoxicated,
and he accepted Jane's story without demur,
indeed he scarcely listened to what she said;
and as the little girl was still asleep when he
went to work in the morning, he really had no
idea that there was any addition to his family
circle.</p>

<p>Harry was enchanted with a playmate so
pretty, so gentle, so near his own age. He
wanted to take her to walk in the street to
show her off, but Jane promptly boxed his ears
and forbade any such thing, on pain of terrific
wrath, so Harry contented himself with offering
her every toy he possessed, and Maud accepted
his attentions like a little queen, and was really
quite happy, except when she thought of her
mother or Denys. But always there was the
same answer to her pleadings to go home.</p>

<p>"To-morrow&#8212;to-morrow&#8212;if you don't cry."</p>

<p>So the days passed on. Each day Jim
drank more and more heavily as he ceased
to resist the temptation, and it took stronger
hold upon him, and each day Jane grew a
little more restless and anxious as she waited
for news of Pattie's downfall. She had counted
on going over to Old Keston, ostensibly to
see her sister and the new baby, but really to
pick up any gossip she could about Pattie;
but though night after night she made up her
mind to go the next day, yet in the morning
her heart failed her. The chance of recognition
was possible, and to take Maud through the
streets to the Nursery, in the glare of the
morning sunshine, seemed to be courting discovery.
Nor did she dare to leave the child
at home alone, because of the neighbours.
She would have left Harry alone with the
utmost indifference, and locked him in, and he
might have been frightened and screamed
and cried all day, for all she would have cared,
and the neighbours could have made any
remarks they liked; but this was different.</p>

<p>She was certainly beginning to be nervous,
and she took more beer than she had ever
taken before, because she felt so much more
cheerful for a little while, and when the
inevitable depression it caused, returned, why
then she took some more!</p>

<p>As her neighbour had remarked, she hated
children, and she became so unutterably wearied
of the care of these three all day and every
day, that she began to wish she had never
troubled about paying Pattie out, or chosen
some way which had not entailed the plague
of three children upon herself.</p>

<p>Still, she had triumphed; she had had her
vengeance. The thought was very sweet, and
the bother to herself would soon be over now.
Indeed, it must be, or Tom would be coming
back.</p>

<p>One Saturday had already passed, since
Maud came, and on the second Saturday three
things happened. News of Pattie came to
her. Wrapped round a haddock which she
had purchased for dinner, was a crumpled
piece of newspaper. The name upon it, "Old
Keston Gazette," caught her eye instantly.
She turned it over and glanced down its columns,
and her eyes rested on one, and a look and a
smile of triumph flashed into her face.</p>

<p>But as she read, her look changed, a deep
and angry flush mounted to her forehead and
spread to her neck. In a sudden transport of
rage, she crumpled up the paper into a ball,
cast it upon the floor and trampled on it, and
then stooping, she picked it up and thrust it
into the fire.</p>

<p>She had failed&#8212;she had been deceived&#8212;tricked&#8212;foiled.
All her efforts had been in
vain! Pattie had escaped from her toils scot-free.
Pattie had never gone to the station
at all. She had stolen the child from one of
its own sisters! She had risked so much for
that! She could have shrieked in her impotent
anger.</p>

<p>Turning, she met the wondering gaze of
the two children, who had stopped in their
play to watch her. She gave them both a
smart box on the ears, and then, further enraged
when they both began to cry, she seized them
roughly and thrust them into the bedroom.
She would gladly have smacked her own baby,
only that he happened to be asleep.</p>

<p>The second happening was a postcard in
the afternoon, from the maid who lived where
she used to wash in Old Keston. Her mistress
was away, she said; the new washerwoman
had not put in an appearance and if Mrs.
Adams was not engaged on Monday, would she
come and oblige?</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams was not engaged. She thought
things over and she decided to go. Not by
her usual trains, however. Something must
be devised about ridding herself of Maud.
She was sick of seeing after the child and she
found herself listening to every heavy footstep
on the stairs. She would go over late on
Monday morning, and returning by a later
train, could observe the movements of the
St. Olave's household when the dusk fell.
She must do something or Tom would be back.</p>

<p>The third happening came late at night.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, Jim came
home at last with very little money in his pocket.</p>

<p>He threw over to Jane her usual housekeeping
money and growled out that he had
not got any extra for Harry this week. She
must make do without it. A child like that
couldn't cost much, anyhow!</p>

<p>That put the finishing touch to Jane's day.
She stormed and raved, she called her husband
names, she threatened all sorts of things, but
as Jim observed, hard words would not draw
blood out of a stone, and he sat there stolidly
smoking and listening to the torrent of words,
till suddenly his patience gave way all at once,
and he declared that if he heard another word,
he would take the money back and do the
housekeeping himself.</p>

<p>That would have suited Jane very ill, and it
sobered her somewhat, and when Jim added
that if they were all going short of food next
week, she had better send that kid of her sister's
home, she became quite silent. It occurred to
her that it might be well not to push Jim too
hard till the child was safely gone. After
that she would have a free hand.</p>

<p>She maintained a sulky silence all Sunday,
but Jim took no notice of her. He went out
directly after breakfast, taking Harry with
him, and they did not return till late at
night.</p>

<p>On Monday morning she announced that
she was going to work, and demanded the
money for the Nursery for Harry, which Jim
had always paid cheerfully, but now he only
retorted that he had no more money, and
went angrily out, apparently heedless of her
reply that if he did not pay, Harry could stop
at home. For a full minute Jim stood outside
on the landing, his hand in his pocket, irresolute.
He was quite unaware that the Nursery
charge was fivepence for one child, eightpence
for two, and tenpence for three, and that Jane
had pocketed any benefit which arose from
sending more than one. He had sixpence to
last him through Monday, but if he left fivepence
of that for the Nursery, he would have
but one penny for beer!</p>

<p>Yesterday his heart had turned away from
his temptation to the fair, innocent little chap
that he meant to be a father to, and he had
taken him out all day, and had never touched
one drop of intoxicating beverage, contenting
himself, and very happily too, with iced
lemonade and soda water and coffee.</p>

<p>But this morning was different. The cruel
trick of his mates rose up in his mind and
held him back from trying again. Then he
had no coffee ready for dinner, even if he
meant to begin again, and it would not hurt
the boy to be left at home alone. Still he
hesitated, conscious that he was weighing
two loves&#8212;the child's welfare; his own desire.</p>

<p>And his own desire conquered.</p>

<p>He went quietly downstairs and out to his
work, and Jane dressed the baby and Maud,
and took them down to her obliging neighbour.</p>

<p>"Take these two down to the Nursery for
me," she said, "I've to go back to my old
work to-day."</p>

<p>Poor little Harry! He stood forlornly in
the middle of the empty room, listening to the
sound of the key turning in the lock, listening
to the sound of his aunt's retreating footsteps.</p>

<p>Then he thought of the happy Nursery
where Maud and Baby had gone; he thought
of his place at the head of the long dinner-table
that somebody else would have this
Monday, and he sat down in a heap on the
floor and cried.</p>

<p>Presently he got up and looked about for
something to do. His dinner stood on the
table, and he thought he might as well eat it
now, and when that was disposed of, he strolled
into the bedroom, and there he spied the corner
of the box that held his best frock, sticking
out from under the bed.</p>

<p>Now was his chance! He would have his
own again, his bright penny and his bestest
pocket-handkerchief with lace upon it.</p>

<p>But the box stuck fast.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Harry wrestled with it.
He pushed and pulled, under the bed and
behind the bed, this way and that, till suddenly,
as he pulled, the obstruction which held it
gave way, the box came out with a run, and
Harry toppled over backwards with a crash,
and an awful sound of breaking china, and a
rushing of cold water.</p>

<p>For a moment Harry lay there stunned,
the broken toilet jug lying in shivers around
him, the water soaking into him from head
to foot; then, as he came to himself, his
startled screams filled the room and he
struggled up and sat looking round.</p>

<p>He was more frightened than hurt, but the
sight of that broken jug terrified him more
than the fall and the wetting. Wouldn't Aunt
Jane whip him when she knew!</p>

<p>There was great tenacity in Harry's character.
He gathered himself up at last, and opened
the box and found his frock and its pocket
and its precious contents. He looked at the
frock a long time lovingly, then he replaced
it, pushed back the box, set the bed straight
and gave an involuntary shiver.</p>

<p>He was soaked from head to foot, and though
it was summer weather, he felt very, very cold.</p>

<p>He sat down by the empty fireplace and
shivered again, and by-and-by he fell fast
asleep and dreamed strange dreams, but always
he was very, very cold.</p>

<h2><a name="xxii" id="xxii"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h2>OUT OF THE NORTH.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>In the stillness of a quiet summer evening,
when the darkness had fallen and the stars
looked down from a far sky, and the soft moonbeams
shone silvery on dark trees and velvet
lawns, John Gray, Bank Manager, knelt at an
open window, his arms resting on the sill,
his face turned skywards.</p>

<p>In the silence, in the stillness of that summer
night, the great battle of his life was being
fought out beneath the stars.</p>

<p>Backwards and forwards raged the battle.
Thoughts of what he must give up if he turned
his back on this temptation and did not satisfy
his desire for strong drink; the friends who
would flaunt him; the friends who would pity
him for his weakness in yielding to the influence
of abstaining noodles; the friends who would
smile and bid one another wait a bit, and
John Gray would be taking his glass with
them again; the awful haunting fear that
they were right, that he would only make
himself ridiculous and never hold out; all
these things seemed ranged on one side against
him, and on the other side what was there?</p>

<p>His wife Elaine. She had promised to help
him, for them to start together, to turn out
of their home and their entertaining all intoxicating
beverages, to stand side by side in their
social circle and be abstainers. Then there
was Reggie. He was helping already. Not
ostentatiously, not in a burdensome way. Only
just a cycle ride here and there, or a walk,
or a concert, or an hour on the church organ,
when Reggie would blow and Mr. Gray, who
was musical, would play as nobody in the
town, not excepting the organist, could play.
Or a game of chess in Mrs. Gray's drawing-room,
while Elaine played or sang to them
and served them with delicious coffee.</p>

<p>There were other friends too&#8212;friends who
had been shy of him and Elaine lately, but
who had once been pleasant, intellectual friends,
and who would be friends again if things were
different.</p>

<p>All these were on the other side.</p>

<p>But he knew, and his head dropped upon
his folded arms with a groan&#8212;he knew that
none of these things would keep him from
satisfying his desire; that they could give
him no strength to resist.</p>

<p>They might indeed claim his attention for
a little while, but surely, as those smiling friends
predicted, he would drift back to the old
temptation.</p>

<p>There were real tears of shame and mortification
in his eyes, as he lifted them to the
sky once more. Oh! if he could only begin
again; if he had only been brought up as an
abstainer, as children were brought up now-a-days;
if he had only taken his stand that side,
as a young man, like companions of his own
youth had done; if only he had been born
strong and not with this weakness.</p>

<p>But all such regrets were unavailing. He
knelt there in the moonlight what he was,
what he had been made, what he had made
himself, and there was something in him
that told him that to-night was a deciding
point in his life.</p>

<p>And to drift needed no strength, no anything.
Only just to get up from his knees
and to go upstairs to bed, and to wake again
to the old life in the morning.</p>

<p>But the very fact that he was kneeling
came to his mind to remind him, and the
quiet sky above him spoke to him of strength
and peace, and suddenly he bowed his head
upon the sill.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, what shall I do?" he moaned.
And softly, a voice out of the past&#8212;his
sweet old grandmother's voice&#8212;came to him
with words he had never heard or heeded,
since she taught them to him in his childhood.</p>

<p>"While we were yet without strength, in
due time Christ died for the ungodly."</p>

<p>Without strength&#8212;the ungodly. That was
himself, and for him Christ died!</p>

<p>The dawn was creeping up the eastern sky
when John Gray softly closed the window
and went upstairs, and there was the dawn
of hope in his heart too, for in his life the Sun
of Righteousness had risen with healing in
His wings.</p>

<p>It was the next day after this that Reggie
Alston received a letter with the Old Keston
post-mark, but after the first glance he laid
it down indifferently. It was not from Gertrude.</p>

<p>After her birthday letter he had expected
another pretty soon, because it had been like
her old letters and she had apologised for its
brevity, but none had come.</p>

<p>This was only from his aunt. She might,
however, mention Gertrude! He opened it and
glanced at the opening words. When was
she to expect him for his holidays?</p>

<p>He sighed as he thought how long it was till
the end of September, when he was to have his
holiday. He had so hoped it would be arranged
during the school vacation, but it had not been.</p>

<p>He turned the page of his aunt's epistle and
then his face changed from listlessness to keen
interest.</p>

<p>"I think," wrote his aunt, "that you cannot
have heard that little Maud Brougham has
been stolen. I thought Gertrude would of
course write you all about it, but you did not
mention it in your last letter to me, and perhaps,
as Gertrude was to blame, she has not liked to
write."</p>

<p>And then his aunt proceeded to tell Reggie
all the story, and all the stories that had grown
upon it. Perhaps in her delight in having so
interesting a tale to tell, she forgot what such a
story might mean to Reggie, for he had never
made any secret of his whole-hearted devotion
to Gertrude, but certainly she did not spare
Gertrude, and to do Reggie's aunt justice, she
fully believed most of the stories of flirtation
and coquetry.</p>

<p>Gertrude had been very little to see her of
late, and in the light of these tales, she naturally
put her own interpretation on the neglect.</p>

<p>Reggie slept very little that night, and it
was with a very pale face that he knocked at
Mr. Gray's private door in the morning.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?" asked the Manager kindly.</p>

<p>Reggie shook his head with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray," he said, "you know my
holiday is a fortnight in the end of September.
Could you possibly make an exception for me
and let me have four days now, and give up
September entirely?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy! it would not be at all
good for you. What's the matter? Anybody
at home ill?"</p>

<p>"No! I've only an aunt."</p>

<p>"Is it the one and only girl in all the world?"</p>

<p>Reggie nodded, and a deep flush swept over
his face. "She's in trouble. Her little sister
has been stolen," he said, feeling some explanation
was due.</p>

<p>"Does she care for you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," said Reggie sadly,
"but I should like to go. It's all I can do,
and it doesn't matter about my part of it,
any way."</p>

<p>"You shall go!" said the Manager quietly.
"You shall go by to-night's mail. Perhaps
things will be better than you fear. You'll
be in London this time to-morrow morning."</p>

<h2>THE MEETING OF THE WAYS.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>Jim could not forget Harry all day. The
hours seemed to drag, and again and again
he caught himself wondering if the time seemed
as long to the little prisoner, shut within his
four walls, with no one to speak to. He determined
to go home immediately after his work
and take the child for a tram-ride. Even his
dinner beer tasted bitter to him to-day, and
when he left his work and turned his steps
homewards he still had fourpence of his precious
sixpence left, wherewith to pay the tram fare.</p>

<p>He was annoyed to find that Jane had not
returned, and that there was no supper ready;
but he ate what he could find and made a cup
of tea.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take you on a tram, Harry,"
he said, laying his hand affectionately on the
boy's shoulder. "Why, child!" he added
in astonishment, "your coat's wet! What
have you been doing?"</p>

<p>Harry's face clouded. He had forgotten
the broken jug for a few minutes in the joy
of his uncle's return.</p>

<p>"I broke aunt's jug," he said faintly, "and
I all got wetted."</p>

<p>Jim got up and went to inspect the extent
of the damage, and he whistled when he saw it.</p>

<p>"Aunt will whip me," said Harry mournfully.</p>

<p>"She'd better not!" said Jim fiercely; "it's
<em>my</em> jug. I'll get another on Saturday. Come,
let's get ready and be gone before she comes
in."</p>

<p>He rubbed his hand over Harry again consideringly.
His knickers had dried upon him,
but his coat was still very damp.</p>

<p>"You ought to put something else on,"
said Jim. "What have you got?"</p>

<p>"There's my frock," cried Harry eagerly,
"my little frock, what mother made. It's
in that box."</p>

<p>Jim pulled out the box and helped Harry
strip off the wet coat. The child gave a little
shiver, but Jim scarcely noticed it then. He
was in a hurry to be off, and in a minute Harry
was arrayed in the frock over the knickers,
and the two went downstairs hand in hand,
just as they had come at Easter-time.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant evening, but the wind was
fresh, and all there was of it met them on the
top of the tram; but no thought of danger
crossed Jim's mind. Harry was very happy
and quite ready to chatter after his long day of
enforced silence, and though by and by he
became very quiet, Jim thought he was tired
and took him on his knee, where he fell asleep.</p>

<p>But all night long he tossed and moaned,
and when the morning came, instead of being
awake with the birds, he lay heavily asleep,
with flushed cheeks and quick drawn breath.</p>

<p>Jim stood looking down on him with a
frown. Then he made himself some coffee
for dinner and went over for another look at
the child.</p>

<p>"Jane," he said sharply, "I believe that
child has got a cold. Don't you let him go
out of the room to-day, and you stop in and
mind him. D'you hear me?" he repeated,
as Jane made no reply. "You're to stop in
and mind the child. No going out to work
or to gossip."</p>

<p>"I've arranged to go to Old Keston," said
Jane shortly. "He's all right, and he can go
to the Nursery."</p>

<p>"He's not to leave the room; and work or
no work, you're going to stop and see to him.
Look here, Jane!" Jim went on sternly, "I'm
master here, though you seemed to forget it
when you brought your sister's child, without
asking me if it was welcome. You've had a
good bit of your own way, but this time it's
going to be <em>my</em> way."</p>

<p>Jane had grown a little pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," she said crossly. "What
a fuss!"</p>

<p>She had settled everything in her own mind
for taking Maud back that very evening, but
after all, one day was as good as another, and
if Jim should once begin on the subject of
Maud, who could tell what he might ferret
out? He might even insist on himself taking
Maud back to her supposed mother and baby
sister, and then what would happen? And it
would be of no use to keep back her sister's
address from him, for there was always Tom.</p>

<p>She made Harry get up, and he played
listlessly with Maud, or fell asleep on the floor
in the midst of the toys; and by evening
time even Jane's careless eyes could see that
the child was really ill.</p>

<p>Jim saw it too, and he went straight out
again and left word at the nearest doctor's
house, for the doctor to come at once. But
the doctor was a busy man, and it was very
late when at last he came and stood looking
down on Harry's flushed little face. He asked
a good many questions, and then made his
examination.</p>

<p>Jim watched him keenly, and somehow his
heart sank down and down and down.</p>

<p>"Is he very bad?" he asked at last, huskily.</p>

<p>The doctor turned away from the little bed
and looked at the fine, tall young fellow before
him.</p>

<p>"I understand he isn't your child?"</p>

<p>Jim shook his head. "He's my dead sister's
child, and his father's dead too. He belongs
to me now, and I'd do anything for him. He's
not very bad, is he, doctor?"</p>

<p>"He's going to join them," said the doctor
abruptly. "There's not the slightest hope&#8212;at
least, I think not&#8212;but I'll do my best.
He's got cold in every bit of him."</p>

<p>Jim groaned. Oh! to have that last fateful
Monday back again&#8212;to live over again these
last weeks of self-indulgence. And now it
was too late&#8212;too late!</p>

<p>But the doctor was pouring out medicines
and directions, and this was no time for vain
regrets.</p>

<p>"You'll sit up with him," he said, and he
looked directly at Jim; "and," he glanced
at Jane this time, "I'll send the nurse. She'll
set you going and look in the first thing in the
morning."</p>

<p>But there was no need. When, having seen
the gravity of the case, the nurse knocked
gently at Jim's door, before six o'clock in the
morning, the little life had fled, and Jim was
kneeling broken-hearted by the little bed,
Harry's sweet face still pillowed on his shoulder.
A soft smile lingered on the little lips and he
seemed asleep, but Jim and the nurse knew
better.</p>

<p>He was dead.</p>

<p>As Tom had said, Jesus had got the beautiful
home ready, and He had sent for Harry.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>It was on this same morning that, by the
first post, Denys received a letter from
Mixham.</p>

<p>She tore it open eagerly, for any letter
nowadays might bring news of Maud, but she
laid it down again listlessly.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" she said, "that is from old
Mrs. Richardson. Her daughter has got married
and gone away, and she is so lonely, and she
sits alone and cries all day, and she says that
I have always cheered her up in all her sorrows
and she wants me to go over to-day; and it
is so bad for her eyes to cry because of her
dressmaking, and when she has seen me she
won't cry any more; but&#8212;oh dear! oh
dear!" and Denys herself burst out crying,
for her nerves had been very much shaken,
"I can't go and comfort anybody. It would
be no use my going for that!"</p>

<p>Yet after breakfast she sought out Mrs.
Brougham.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said, "I think I'll go to Mrs.
Richardson this afternoon. I'm afraid I'm
getting selfish in my sorrow, and I'll go, too,
and see little Harry Lyon, as I'm over there.
I did go once, you know, but everybody was
out. The neighbour said his aunt went out
washing on Mondays, and Harry was sent to
the Nursery. I think perhaps I ought to go."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said her mother with a sigh.
"Well, I won't keep you, dear, but oh, do
take Pattie with you, just for companionship.
I shouldn't feel so anxious while you were
gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, but the work," said Denys.</p>

<p>Gertrude looked up from the table where
she was correcting exercises.</p>

<p>"I'll see to the work," she said. "I shall
be at home all day. It's a pity for mother to
feel anxious, and Pattie deserves a change.
She's been awfully good to us."</p>

<p>Denys acquiesced, though she felt that
Pattie's company was very unnecessary, and
so, immediately after an early lunch, Pattie
and Denys found themselves stepping out of
the train at Mixham Junction.</p>

<p>"I think we'll go to see Harry first," said
Denys. "Mrs. Richardson will want to give
us tea and we must not be late."</p>

<p>Pattie followed obediently. Little Harry was
but a name to her, for he came to brighten
Tom's life after she had gone out of it, and
she had never heard of Harry's connection with
Jane Adams. She knew the road into which
Denys turned, however, well enough, and when
Denys stopped at the very house where Jane
Adams lived, she only thought it was a queer
coincidence, and wondered vaguely what she
should do if she met Jane on the stairs.</p>

<p>Denys knocked at the first door in the entry,
and asked if the Adams's were likely to be in,
and which their room was.</p>

<p>She thought the woman looked at her
curiously, as she gave her the number on the
third floor.</p>

<p>"They're in," she said, with another of
those curious looks; "they're in, 'cept the
little girl and the baby. I took 'em to the
Nursery to be out of the way."</p>

<p>Denys passed on and knocked softly at the
door indicated, and Pattie followed trembling,
for this was no coincidence&#8212;this was reality.</p>

<p>Jim himself opened the door, and when
he saw Denys he drew back with a gasp.</p>

<p>"Is Harry at home?" she asked. "You
said I might come and see him."</p>

<p>Jim tried to answer, but no words would
come. He drew back for Denys to enter,
however, and Pattie followed her timidly, and
Jim closed the door softly behind them.</p>

<p>Once more he tried to speak&#8212;to explain&#8212;but
Denys did not notice him. In the centre
of the room, where the afternoon light fell
full upon it, stood a child's crib, and on the
white pillow lay the beautiful, familiar little
face that had so won its way into her heart.</p>

<p>"Harry," she said softly, crossing the room
quickly and longing to hear again the tones
that were so like Jerry's, "Harry!"</p>

<p>Was he asleep? She bent over the crib, and
then turned bewildered to Jim.</p>

<p>There was no need for words.</p>

<p>She stood a moment spellbound, looking
down on the little peaceful face, with its lingering
smile, and then she went round the crib
and knelt down by the lowered side and softly
kissed Harry's forehead and soft golden hair.</p>

<p>She had not seen Jerry's dead face nor kissed
him for good-bye, and she knelt beside Harry
and wept for them both.</p>

<p>She had completely forgotten Pattie, but
after a while, as she wiped away her tears and
listened to Jim's story of the child's illness,
she became conscious that there was another
man in the room, and that Pattie and he were
conversing in low tones by the window. She
glanced round for Harry's aunt, but there was
no one else there; only sundry sounds of stirring
about in an adjoining room suggested that
she was not far off, but was not inclined to see
company. So with one more long look, one
more kiss on the fair, still face, Denys and
Pattie at last took their leave, and set out for
Mrs. Richardson's.</p>

<p>As they left the street, Pattie looked up in
Denys's face with crimsoning cheeks.</p>

<p>"Miss Denys," she said shyly, "that was
my Tom that was talking to me. He was there
taking a photo of the little dead boy, for he
loved him, Miss, and&#8212;and&#8212;him and me,
we've made it up, Miss Denys! We've always
loved each other all along."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>The visit to Mrs. Richardson was over, and
Denys and Pattie were once more on their
homeward way, hurrying along the crowded
streets and threading their way in and out of
the bustling crowds, with no thought in their
minds but of an accomplished task and a great
anxiety not to lose their train.</p>

<p>They took little heed of the passers-by,
but their eyes were both attracted at the same
moment by a very tall, fine-looking young
fellow who was coming towards them with a
big, bouncing baby swung high upon his
shoulder; even at a good distance they made
a conspicuous couple as they came down the
street.</p>

<p>"There's Jim Adams," said Denys and Pattie
in the same breath.</p>

<p>Jim was walking very slowly, occasionally
glancing down at the ground, but the people
about him were too many to reveal at what he
looked. Whether he caught sight of Denys
and Pattie, and could not face speaking to
them, or whether he never even saw them,
Denys could not tell, but as they neared him,
he stopped suddenly and looked into a shop
window, showing the baby something that
made it shout and crow with delight; but in
one instant Denys forgot everything else in
the world, but the strangeness of another sight
that met her eyes.</p>

<p>She stood stock still in the centre of the
pavement, gazing at a figure that was coming
towards her.</p>

<p>The figure of a little, little girl, walking alone
among the crowd, yet not of it. A little girl
with brown, fluffy curls, turning to gold at the
roots, crowned by a big white sailor hat with a
black ribbon round it&#8212;a little girl dressed in
a short black frock with a kilt and a sailor
jacket; a little girl so like&#8212;ah! how many
children had she seen lately so like little Maud!
Then the child's blue eyes met hers, and, with
a scream, Denys had sprung forward, and
Maud&#8212;little lost Maud&#8212;was in her arms.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>When Denys began once more to realise
anything beyond the pressure of her arms
round their lost treasure, she became conscious
that a little crowd had gathered, and that
Pattie was hurriedly explaining what had
happened, and there was pity and sympathy
in the listening faces around, so that Denys
thought wonderingly how kind the world was.</p>

<p>"A cab!" she said, and she lifted her head
as if she were but just awakened from a long
and horrible dream. Oh! how glad she was
to have Pattie with her!</p>

<p>With Maud still clasped in her arms, she and
Pattie got into the cab, and as it rumbled off to
the station, the little crowd that had gathered,
thinned away and scattered, and Jim Adams
and his baby went with it.</p>

<p>Jim had been to the Nursery to fetch the
two children. It was upon little Maud, running
beside him, that he had constantly glanced
down. When he stopped to look into the shop
window she had not observed it, but had trotted
on among the crowd, and he, turning to see
what had become of her, had seen the meeting
between her and Denys. Thinking simply
that the child knew Denys and loved her, as
Harry did, he had drawn near to claim her,
and had heard Pattie's hurried explanation, and
hearing it, he had drawn further and further
to the edge of the crowd.</p>

<p>But Maud had been too far from him, for
any of the passing crowd to suspect that she
belonged to him. He saw that in a moment,
and he waited calmly in the background till
Denys and Pattie and the child had driven away.</p>

<p>He understood it all, if no one else did.</p>

<p>So that was Jane's vengeance! That was
what Jane could do!</p>

<p>The sooner he and Jane and the baby were
out of Mixham the better! What was there to
stay for? He hated the whole place. Perhaps
he might begin again somewhere else.</p>

<p>He would try, and he would&#8212;yes, he would&#8212;ask
God to help him this time. Tom said
that was the only way to keep straight, to ask
for God's strength.</p>

<p>And Tom and Pattie had made it up that
very day, in Jane's own kitchen!</p>

<h2><a name="xxiv" id="xxiv"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h2>THE SUN SHINES OUT.</h2>
<br />
<br />
<p>As Reggie opened the gate of St. Olave's and
glanced up at the familiar ivy-encircled windows,
he felt as if a dream that he had often seen
before, had come again to him, and that he
should only wake to find himself back in the
dull little sitting-room in Scotland, trying to
find an uneasy rest on the horsehair sofa.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brougham was sitting in the bow-window;
she always sat there nowadays, and
there was reality enough in her pale, weary
face. Almost the first smile that had lightened
it since Maud had disappeared, came to it
when she saw Reggie.</p>

<p>"Oh, Reggie!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Reggie came to the open window and leaned
on the sill.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," he said, lifting up his face
to kiss her. He had always called her mother
and kissed her, since the days when he had worn
knickers and been Gertrude's chum. "Well,
mother, aren't you surprised to see me?"</p>

<p>"Very," she said, "is it your holidays?"</p>

<p>Reggie nodded. "I only heard yesterday
about Maud," he said gently. "There's
nothing fresh&#8212;no news, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Mrs. Brougham, hopelessly.</p>

<p>She felt somehow comforted by Reggie's
coming. He was so like one of themselves, so
old a friend that there was nothing to explain,
no need for excusing words, no fear that his
sympathy would make the sorrow wake again.</p>

<p>Reggie felt it too. He stood there quite
silent for a minute, still holding her hand;
then he said,</p>

<p>"If you knew where Gertrude would be this
afternoon, I could go and meet her. She'll be
so surprised to see me."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Brougham mechanically.
She knew far, far more of those stories
about Gertrude, than Gertrude ever guessed.
Even in those early summer days of the picnics
and tennis parties that had filled all Gertrude's
mind, Conway and Willie had confided to their
mother that they wished Gertrude would not
be quite so <em>pleasant</em>. She sighed a little as
she looked into Reggie's bright, open face.
Girls did not always know true gold when they
saw it. Then she remembered that Reggie
had asked her a question.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said hastily, "I was forgetting.
Come in, Reggie; she is at home
this afternoon. Denys had to go to Mixham,
and I persuaded her to take Pattie with her&#8212;I
am so nervous now," she added pathetically,
"and Gertrude has been busy in the kitchen
all the afternoon, but she's done now, and I
believe she went to the drawing-room to study."</p>

<p>"I'll go round the garden way and disturb
her," said Reggie, with a laugh.</p>

<p>He thought as he went round the garden
that "Gertrude busy in the kitchen all the
afternoon," had an odd sound.</p>

<p>Gertrude had not begun to study. She sat
in a deep armchair, her books unopened on
her lap, looking out upon the sunny garden, and
brooding drearily over the past, wondering
sadly whether, if Maud were never, never found,
she could ever feel happy again! And if happiness
did come to her, and Maud had not come
back, how terrible that would be, for it would
mean that she had forgotten Maud, forgotten her
wrong-doing; that she had become again the
self-loving, self-centred being that had lost
Maud!</p>

<p>As Reggie's figure crossed the grass she
sprang up, and her books fell with a clatter
to the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, Reggie!" she said, just as her mother
had done.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Reggie, "I've come! I only
heard yesterday."</p>

<p>A flood of colour swept over Gertrude's face,
but the room was shaded, and she hoped
Reggie would not see. What must he think
of the story he had only heard yesterday! She
had wished that he might know about it.
Now she felt as if he were the only one in the
world, from whom she would gladly have
hidden it.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said; "all the others
are out, except mother."</p>

<p>"I've seen her," he said quietly.</p>

<p>There was a pause. There seemed nothing
to say, absolutely nothing! Nothing that
could be said, at least.</p>

<p>At last Reggie broke the silence.</p>

<p>"What have you done to trace her?" he
asked. Perhaps it was the easiest question he
could have asked. Gertrude could answer that,
and she told him all that had been done. "I
wish there was something I could do," he said,
when she paused.</p>

<p>"Is it your holidays?" she asked indifferently.
"I'm afraid there's nothing much
going on in Old Keston just now. You'll
find it very dull."</p>

<p>"That won't matter to me. I have to go
back on Monday."</p>

<p>"Oh! Have you had a nice time the first
part? I thought you were going to have a
fortnight in September."</p>

<p>As Gertrude could think of nothing to say,
Reggie's holiday seemed a very safe subject.</p>

<p>He laughed a little.</p>

<p>"This is the first part; I came up by last
night's mail, I haven't even been home yet. I
came off directly I heard about Maud and all
your trouble. I was so awfully sorry, and
letters are not the least bit of use for saying
what you feel."</p>

<p>"It's very good of you," said Gertrude
gratefully. "Shall you come home again in
September?"</p>

<p>"Oh! there won't be any September,"
said Reggie cheerfully.</p>

<p>There was another pause and then Gertrude
said in a very low voice,</p>

<p>"Reggie, have you heard <em>all</em> the stories that
they tell?"</p>

<p>"I expect so," answered Reggie soberly;
"but, Gertrude, I would have given up all
my holiday, except one hour, if I could just
say one word to comfort you."</p>

<p>She looked up at him suddenly, startled.</p>

<p>"Reggie," she said, "do you mean that you
gave up all your holiday just to get four days
to come up and comfort me? Me! after all
you have heard!"</p>

<p>"I don't even <em>think</em> about those stories,"
said Reggie, half scornfully, half indignantly.</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Gertrude wistfully.
"Oh, Reggie, it is a comfort just to see you
sitting there; it is indeed! Except at home
here&#8212;and they've been so good to me&#8212;you
are the first that has said one kind word to
me about it all. I knew you would when you
heard. Only I don't feel as if I ought to be
looking for comfort or happiness for myself
till she is found; you'll understand that,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand. But that's your side
of it, Gertrude. There's another side, and
that's my side. I want you to listen to what
I've come all the way from Scotland to say.
I've said it to myself for years. Last night,
when the train was rushing down through
England, I was saying it to myself over and
over again. Now I'm going to say it to you.</p>

<p>"Gertrude, I love you, I shall always love
you, I want you to belong to me for always. I
only think of the happiness of my life as bound
up in you. I think of your love as the best and
happiest thing God can give me.</p>

<p>"That's my side of this matter, and I want
you to think of it often, and then, when little
Maud is found, and we can talk about our
own happiness, then you must tell me what
you think about your side of it."</p>

<p>"Gertrude! Gertrude!"</p>

<p>The voice rang through the house as no
voice had rung through it since Maud went
away, and there was that in the sound of it,
which made Gertrude and Reggie spring to
their feet and rush to the door.</p>

<p>In the hall was a confused group, and in
the centre of the group was a little figure in a
short black kilted frock with a sailor jacket,
and a big white hat with a black ribbon that
half hid the fluffy brown hair, that was turning
golden at the roots.</p>

<p>For a moment Gertrude stood staring, as
Denys had done, then the familiar blue eyes
met hers, and the silvery little voice said
gleefully,</p>

<p>"Hullo, Gertrude! I've come back."</p>

<p>"Maud! Maud! Oh, my darling, my darling!"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>Reggie returned to the North on Monday,
and when he went, a beautiful little half hoop
of diamonds sparkled upon Gertrude's left hand.
It was Reggie's greatest treasure, for it had
been his mother's engagement ring; but the
wearing of that ring was the only enlightenment
which Old Keston received about
Gertrude's and Reggie's affairs.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Brougham observed, people could
see what they liked, but they did not deserve
to hear anything.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p>"And so," said Mrs. Gray, as Reggie finished
telling his tale in her drawing-room, "and so
nobody knows who took the child or how she
came to be found again."</p>

<p>"Nobody," repeated Reggie with emphasis.
But he was mistaken. There was one man
who knew. A man who had gone forth at last
"in the strength of the Lord God," and who
had conquered. A man, who was holding out
loving, strengthening hands to his wife, and to
many another tempted one; but he never
told anybody what he knew, not even Tom,
for Jane was Tom's sister!</p>
